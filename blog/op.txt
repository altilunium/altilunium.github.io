So, around the time chapter 1044 came out I got the idea in my head to reread One Piece. I was specifically looking for evidence of Nika anywhere in the story. I read one volume per day for 104 days. I took notes as I went. I was typically reading the Viz translations but I also read fan scans and checked the anime to get an alternate translation to try and figure out what was originally written in the Japanese text.

* 4/1/22 Volume 1
   * Chapter 1
      *  Volume intro: Oda says that pirates were ‘too busy having fun to write down their adventures’ They were actually mostly illiterate
      * Nami is depicted before Zoro despite not being introduced until later
      * Luffy gets angry very quickly
      * The devil fruit just appears in Luffy’s hand, there is no chest on the table like some anime depictions
      * The fruit’s chest had a lock on it
      * Lucky Roux shoots a man in cold blood and doesn’t even put his meat chunk down
      * Luffy called Shanks a coward but got mad that the mountain bandit called Shanks a coward
      * Shanks’s ‘Haki moment’ needs a few panels to take
      * Narrator calls Shanks a good man
   * Chapter 2
      * Alvida’s a fat ugly bitch lol
      * Alvida uses the same weapon as Kaido
      * For some reason the Anime started here
      * Zoro is given the silhouette treatment marking the first Oda Intro
      * First mention of the One Piece by name
      * Pg 20 Luffy smirks but its nii not nika
      * Pg 23 Koby says that Luffy ate of the Gomu Gomu Tree but this is a mistranslation and it is Luffy explaining to Koby what his power is. No tree is mentioned in Japanese
      * First mention of the Grand Line
   * Chapter 3
      * Helmeppo points to a sign that appears out of nowhere and repeats what is written plainly on it
      * Helmeppo orders a marine to throw the girl over the wall literally. Like they don’t just escort her out they lob her like a frisbee
      * I don’t know how much Oda had planned out during the prototypes, but you can really see in the conversation between Zoro and Luffy that there’s space for Luffy to explain the difference between Peacemains and Morganeers
      * The older volumes have activities like drawing pirate flags in them
   * Chapter 4
      * Helmeppo Calls Luffy ‘Baaaaaka’ which was translated as ‘booger face’
      * Viz clearly had an audience for this series in mind which I’m sure will not come back to haunt them
      * Captain Morgan says ‘I’m so great!!’ and even builds a statue of himself despite being squarely in the middle of Navy ranks
      * Captain Morgan says Helmeppo isn’t worth hitting and then proceeds to hit him
      * The statue is “a monument to [his] rank and power”
      * They put the statue on top of a building
      * Koby gets shot in the chest and lives
   * Chapter 5
      * First flashback arc
      * It will later be retconned that Zoro got his original 2 swords from a blacksmith from Wano who lost his mojo and that’s why the swords are crap
      * I can’t believe Kuina actually died from falling down the stairs, that is exactly what happened in Nippon
   * Chapter 6
      * Random sailor refers to the Devil Fruits as, ‘… The secret treasure from those seas!!?’ may or may not be the Grand Line
      * I’ve never understood why swords work on Luffy. Like yeah you can slash a tire but like you have to hit the side where the rubber is thin. Shouldn’t Luffy’s rubber be thick since he has muscles and bones and such?
      * There are several swords that could easily cut Zoro even with his ‘block’
      * Luffy kicks along with punches
      * Pg 10 the bullet hole in Koby has disappeared
      * Morgan orders his guys to shoot themselves and they almost do
      * Pg 19 Koby’s wound is missing at the top of the page, its back at the bottom of the page
      * Zoro actually takes down Morgan
   * Chapter 7
      * Luffy beats the shit out of Koby to prove a point
   * Chapter 8
      * The bird grabbing Luffy by the head gag was used in the pilot
      * Shouldn’t Luffy’s neck start stretching so his body is dangling a mile below his head?
      * Nami perfectly predicts a storm about 5m wide, parks her ship under it, and tricks a pirate crew just in time for them to be shipwrecked by the small storm
      * The buggy pirates mention that Buggy has a devil fruit, for a while (when i was a kid) I thought that meant Buggy would also stretch
      * Luffy starts to get pissy about his hat but earlier Alvida crushed his hat with her mace and he didn’t care
* 4/2/22 Volume 2
   * Chapter 9
      * Oda mentions the lyrics of a northern European pirate song but I can’t find the song anywhere
      * Is it a map of the Grand Line or a map to the Grand Line?
      * Oda very carefully hides Buggy’s left hand while it is choking a guy across the room
      * ‘One hundred million berries is a lot of money’ I wonder about that, sure it’s high for the East Blue but among ‘great pirates’ that seems kind of low
      * Nami’s rejection of Luffy the moment she learns he’s a pirate again reminds me of the Peacemain/Morganeer thing
      * Nami thinks Luffy’s hat has a map hidden inside it, her own greed makes it impossible for her to understand sentimental value
      * Maybe it was intentional but I doubt that; Nami likes money and tangerines, the money is greed but the tangerines are sentimental, yet she puts them on the same level
      * Nami always carries a rope
      * Luffy is put in a cage, couldn’t he just squish his way out. He actually did in one of the pilots
   * Chapter 10
      * The cover page shows a pig wearing that Japanese bandit scarf thing and it has a devil fruit pattern on it, to my knowledge there is no pig fruit
      * Also, so far there are only Paramecia fruits
      * Nami being 4’5” and 70lbs can outdrink the entire Buggy pirate crew
      * I like this panel  
      * Luffy mocks Nami for not having the balls to blast him with a cannon
      * Luffy is actually leaving marks in the bars where he’s chewing. If he had enough time, he could have chewed his way out.
   * Chapter 11
   * Luffy is depicted on the cover racing a leopard. That might be relevant later
   * Buggy is immune to slash, Luffy is immune to blunt
   * Nami: “No pirate would sacrifice himself to save a friend” there are several pirates good and bad that would do this
   * Chapter 12
   * There are a lot of color pages early on, shame they’re printed in black and white
   * There are no sound effects or anything to show this but Luffy must be moving his cage from within the cage
   * The lion attacks a pet food store because it’s hungry. I feel like a lion would want bloody meat not dry kibble
   * Chapter 13
   * Luffy is supposed to be angry about the pet store being destroyed but he looks more bored than anything                          
   * Nami is mad at Luffy because I think she thinks he burned down the pet store? But at the same time, she was with him when the store was burning?
      * Chapter 14
      * “What kind of mayor stands back and watches his town be destroyed!?” in my experience most
      * Chapter 15
      * There’s a bunch of ‘pirate speak’ all over the place, I wonder when that stopped. It wasn’t in the Japanese
      * Buggy’s goal is to rule the Grand Line. Later on, he’s a complete coward. I’m sure this is just a retconning thing but he doesn’t show any plain cowardice in his introduction
      * Chapter 16
      * Chapter 17
      * Unicycle guy calls them kamikaze tops but none of them explode
      * Luffy again says it’s a map of the Grand Line
      * Buggy says Luffy reminds him of a young Shanks, Shanks also said Luffy reminds him of a young Shanks
      * The activity section includes a papercraft Luffy with a stretchy arm
      * 4/3/22 Volume 3
      * Chapter 18
      * Buggy, like Nami, is unable to understand that Luffy can treasure the hat itself
      * Chapter 19
      * Luffy must be using some of that untrained invisible Haki since he smacks buggy around without Buggy coming apart
      * Rayleigh makes his first appearance so does Scopper
      * A wide shot of the ship they are on is shown, it doesn’t quite look like the Oro Jackson and there’s no giant egg
      * Chapter 20
      * Nami decides to mock Buggy while within stabbing range
      * Nami says she’d never take lessons from Buggy despite the fact that they have the same goals and desires
      * Chapter 21
      * There’s a random crosshair on one of Nami’s speech bubble on page 1
      * The Strawhats have been run out of town twice now
      * Chapter 22
      * The hat is apparently easily damaged, later Luffy will fight a dragon and his hat will be completely unharmed
      * I wonder if there were more modern bullets with conical heads would they be able to pierce Luffy?
      * They keep mentioning the Gum-Gum tree but trees were never mentioned. It confused me as a child, made me think there were several copies of any given fruit that all come from the same tree
      * First mention of the Red Line
      * You get a lot of talk early on about people returning from the Grand Line for hype and such but as far as I remember there’s no real way out
      * Luffy has been laughing ‘hahahaha’ not his iconic ‘shishishi’
      * Chapter 23
      * Luffy actually mentions that they need food, not a cook specifically but food. The musician gag hasn’t started yet
      * Usopp’s nose looks almost human compared to his later Pinocchio nose
      * Usopp’s explanation for his daily lie is to make the village less boring
      * Usopp suggests that they go to Kaya for a ship because she’s rich. Not because there’s already a ship there, he doesn’t even ask them to help cheer her up. If I were the Strawhats, I’d assume this is another one of Usopp’s lies
      * Chapter 24
      * Kuro pushes up his glasses, upon re-reading this makes him evil
      * I like to think Kuro was giving Kaya poison instead of medicine since she immediately heals after Kuro is beaten
      * Usopp mentions a land of little people and a giant goldfish
      * Usopp arguing with Kuro about Yasopp’s pirating seems like a spot for Peacemain/Morganeer
      * Chapter 25
      * Interesting that Kuro accuses Usopp of being deceitful and twisting the truth. Usopp’s not really lying to get anything meanwhile Kuro is a master planner so they are good foils.
      * Kuro crying about how he’d never be able to live with himself if she died is disgusting
      * First mention of Shanks being famous from someone who doesn’t know him personally.
      * Chapter 26
      * 4/4/22 Volume 4
      * Chapter 27
      * Usopp is a bad liar. Later he runs around telling the truth emphatically. The villagers call him out specifically because it’s the same lie he always tells. Later he tries to get Kaya away but she thinks he’s lying too. He is clearly emotionally distraught but Kaya thinks he’s trying to get back at Kuro. Like seriously, I could understand if she was confused but she thinks he’s lying. Like neither of them really believed the stories Usopp was telling so why would Kaya think Usopp is actually lying to manipulate her? I get the boy-who-cried-wolf thing but he’s clearly scared and emotionally affected; when he lies, he’s usually happy or hard-faced.
      * The SBS has begun
      * Chapter 28
      * I’ve suddenly noticed that at this stage Oda draws eye pops like this          
      * I don’t get why Kuro destroys the specialized glasses that Kaya bought him. He doesn’t take annoyances lightly so why wouldn’t he take glasses that he doesn’t have to constantly push up. He even says he’ll accept gifts from her
      * Roronoa Zoro is named after a pirate named L’ollonois. For some reason Viz used Rs for the last name and an L in the first name. Its literally the least correct translation possible
         * Chapter 29
         * Luffy has more trouble with direction than Zoro. Despite Luffy getting a head start and Zoro having to climb an oiled slope they actually arrive at the same time implying Zoro is actually quite good at finding his way
         * Chapter 30
         * It is interesting that Luffy gets hypnotized into super strength since it was shown he was susceptible to hypnotism earlier
         * SBS: Luffy by defeating his enemies destroys their will to go on
         * Chapter 31
         * Kaya has a nightmare about Usopp trying to kill her despite the fact that he was almost in tears when she last saw him
         * The skinny meow brother seems like the only one who would actually work under Kuro since he uses underhanded tactics like making Zoro underestimate him and wearing clothes that are too big for him. The rest are just brutes
         * SBS: Nami willing to sell her body for money
         * Chapter 32
         * Momonosuke’s dragon form cameos on the cover art
         * Usopp shoots at the pussy brothers and Zoro gets in the way. Why doesn’t Usopp shoot at Luffy to wake him?
         * Kuro asks what in Neptune’s name is going on, referring of course to the king of the fishmen
         * Chapter 33
         * Chapter 34
         * Luffy is not immune to slash. Luffy takes a chakram to the head like its nothing, he even bleeds
         * Chapter 35
         * First cover story
         * Kuro knows about Devil Fruits
         * Kuro’s glasses break completely but I guess they’re just reading glasses since he only improves in combat past this point
         * 4/5/22 Volume 5
         * Chapter 36
         * Luffy throws boulders like they’re nothing
         * This is the angriest I’ve ever seen Luffy  
         * SBS: There was an OVA before the original anime that takes place between Gaimon and Usopp called, ‘Defeat them! The Ganzak Pirates’
            * Chapter 37
            * Kuro is a pretty boring fight, it might be the first power level fight
            * Kuro being ‘of the thousand plans’ is very unlike the rest of his crew.
            * Kuro is the one who broke Captain Morgan’s jaw. Morgan’s right hand is always conveniently out of frame
            * Luffy breaks Kuro’s claws but a broken sword could still stab good
            * Chapter 38
            * People get hit in the dick a lot in early one piece
            * Proof that this is a power level fight: Luffy out speeds Kuro
            * Kuro goes so fast even he can’t see where he’s going, so he just slashes wildly
            * Chapter 39
            * Django gets kicked in the dick for the third time
            * Chapter 40
            * Usopp, true to the liar he is, decides to lie and say that nothing happened that morning
            * Chapter 41
            * Luffy and Zoro eat bones
            * Kaya’s other butler gives up the ship he spent his free time designing and building to a bunch of pirates because his employer asked him to
            * It is revealed that Usopp actually lies because his mom died. This is like ‘wubalubadubdub’ from Rick & Morty but played straight
            * Kaya wants to become a doctor. I don’t know if that ever comes up
            * Chapter 42
            * Musician gag begins
            * Yosaku immediately recovers from scurvy after drinking lime juice. People say Luffy growing his teeth back are indicative that the toon fruit was always the plan
            * SBS: somebody asks about ‘ta-dah’ they are probably asking about the ‘don’. Oda felt the need to answer the question
            * Chapter 43
            * I’m pretty sure this was meant to be Arlong. That might be his nose  
            * Speaking of noses Usopp still has his triangular human-ish nose
            * Luffy deflects a cannonball and somehow hits the backside of Baratie
            * Lieutenant Fullbody apparently has a private stock of flies
            * Sanji’s eyebrow curls away from the center of his face but post time skip it swirls towards the center. So, both his eyebrows together would look like this: ؎؎
               * Chapter 44
               * I like that Patty tells customers ‘Enjoy your shit’
               * Sanji and Patty both seem to talk with Brooklyn accents




               * 4/6/22 Volume 6
               * Chapter 45
               * Gin tells Luffy about the horrors of the Grand Line. The same thing later happens with the New World. However, the Grand Line is mostly as bad as the regular world. Sure, there are sea kings in the Grand Line but there was a sea king outside of Luffy’s village
               * SBS: Django gets his powers from a magic mushroom
               * Chapter 46
               * Pg 6 Usopp’s nose has become less sharp
               * Don Krieg is apparently famous for going back on his word
               * SBS: Oda says he draws 3 weeks ahead
               * Chapter 47
               * Don Krieg has 5,000 men. Let’s remember that for later
               * Chapter 48
               * Zeff has a logbook of the Grand Line but it might actually be useless considering there are several different routes from Reverse Mountain
               * Chapter 49
               * Gin seems very out of place with the Krieg pirates. A lot of these early One Piece villains seem to rule with fear but later most crews are nakama. But the early crews still seem to be nakama among themselves, but not with their captain.
               * It’s weird to see Johnny and Yosaku swimming, after you’ve read a while you just forget most people can do that
               * Chapter 50
               * Luffy sends everyone but himself after Nami, despite the fact that that would leave him marooned, he can’t navigate, and has no idea where she is going
               * SBS: Oda really likes to conflate vikings and pirates for some reason
               * Chapter 51
               * Nu Alvida has appeared in the cover story
               * The paneling of all of Zoro’s memories makes it look like he is about to die
               * Chapter 52
               * The Strawhats split up in this chapter
               * Chapter 53
               * Krieg implies that Mihawk has a devil fruit, this might have been true at the time but has been replaced with haki
               * Krieg actually believes that Zeff knows where the One Piece is and didn’t take it for himself
               * I like that the chefs fight with giant cutlery
               * Sanji throws his first kick
               * 4/7/22 Volume 7
               * Chapter 54
               * When I was a kid, I didn’t have volume 6 and the intro doesn’t mention that Nami stole the Merry so I was completely lost when we eventually reached her again
               * Sanji balances on his hand to do a spinning kick, wouldn’t that put a lot of pressure on his hands that are ‘too precious to damage’
               * I wonder if this Pearl dude inspired Gaara
               * Chapter 55
               * I made the point earlier that Nami is shocked by the concept of brotherhood among pirates; interestingly the cover story shows the Buggy pirates having a tragic funeral for their, presumed dead, captain
               * Pearl can make fire by banging pearls together, he must be part Lunarian
               * Krieg uncaringly remarks that Pearl will burn the ship down. Currently his only other option for a ship has been split in half so not doing anything would strand them all at sea
               * The other Krieg pirates make it seem like Pearl’s fire is an involuntary defense mechanism but Pearl seems completely lucid and aware
               * Krieg keeps standing there like Jiren, as if this isn’t a life-or-death situation for him as much as for the Baratie crew
               * SBS: Oda says that Sanji’s eyebrows are because of rotational energy
               * Chapter 56
               * Do they ever explain how Sanji managed to get past the Red Line?
               * I get the dream of the All Blue and such, but don’t you need spices? Or non-fish or fruit
               * It’s smart to contrast how Sanji insisted on eating everything given in the present but threw away food like a normal person during the flashback
               * Chapter 57
               * Chapter 58
               * This SBS marks the second time somebody suggested Zoro mutilating Luffy as a special move
               * Chapter 59
               * The ship is still on fire, you figure a sea restaurant would have some sort of solution for this sort of thing
               * Luffy refuses to acknowledge the Baratie as Zeff or Sanji’s treasure
               * SBS: Oda characterizes a response from Luffy as ‘no mercy’
               * Chapter 60
               * Pg6 one dude on the left side of the middle panel has devil fruit hair
               * Kuro somehow made top ten in the first character poll
               * Chapter 61
               * Pg8 Gin has Luffy’s gear 4 flames in the background
               * Chapter 62
               * 4/8/22 Volume 8
               * Chapter 63
               * The volume cover shows Krieg, Gin, and Pearl but Gin and Pearl have already been removed from the battle
               * Luffy manages to punch Krieg through his armor. Interestingly this is one of the more possible attacks in the series, considering that people can still get broken ribs and internal bleeding through bullet proof vests and concussions can still happen through helmets
               * Luffy passes out from blood loss at the end of the Kuro fight but he seems to be losing a lot more blood here
               * Chapter 64
               * Kuina appears as the banner for the SBS
               * SBS: the penis question has appeared
               * Chapter 65
               * Zeff says ‘he who hesitates is buzzard food’. Binks’s Sake has not been introduced
               * Krieg has the gall to say he’s the world’s strongest man. I know East Blue is backwater but even someone as conceited as Krieg couldn’t be that ignorant of the rest of the world
               * I’ve noticed in these early Volumes the SBS only has one banner for the entire volume but later volumes have several. I wonder when that changes.
               * Chapter 66
               * SBS: Oda introduces the naval rankings
               * Chapter 67
               * Sanji gives orders to Carne and Patty like he owns the damn place
               * Chapter 68
               * Fishmen Island is first mentioned, we haven’t actually reached Arlong Park yet
               * Zeff: “Not a day goes by that I don’t regret saving your worthless life”
               * Chapter 69
               * Cover page shows some reindeer and Usopp’s nose is starting to become more cartoony
               * Zeff said some people call the Grand Line ‘Paradise’
               * Shichibukai are introduced, Mihawk is mentioned as one and Jinbe is also named
               * Luffy says the seven must be impressive but in my experience, I’ve mostly seen them lose
               * Yosaku mentions three great powers in the Grand Line, the shichibukai being one, he doesn’t actually say what the other two are. I assume the other two are the Yonko and the Marines but the Marines aren’t unique to the Grand Line and the Yonko aren’t typically in the part of the Grand Line he’s talking about
               * Captain Nezumi may be our first example of a custom laugh. Never mind Buggy actually has a custom laugh. Luffy still doesn’t ‘shishishi’
               * SBS: Oda states that Luffy is natural rubber, wouldn’t that make him a Logia?
               * Chapter 70
               * Ah yes, the old Swastika chapter. I remember when I first read this chapter, I was stunned to see it in anything and I thought, “wow these guys must be really evil,” and Arlong’s whole racism angle really didn’t help matters. I checked at the bookstore, the manji is still in print right now.
               * Usopp still has nostrils
               * SBS: The D. question has been asked, literally a thousand chapters later and it still hasn’t been answered
               * SBS: Oda answers a question about Rum and pirates
               * Chapter 71
               * Arlong says that Fishmen evolved from humans. I wonder if that’s true, if humans and fishman are the same species. I know Big Mom has a half fishman daughter so clearly the two cannot be that far apart genetically. But then again Big Mom has bred with every race under the sun so who knows what the requirements are
               * Also, nothing of Arlong so far has sold the slavery angle
               * I’m glad Zoro drowns himself just to fuck with Nami
               * 4/9/22 Volume 9
               * Chapter 72
               * Nami’s feet on the cover are bigger than her head
               * Arlong already blows Krieg and Kuro out of the water. The fact that he actually starts doing shit in his first few chapters, his use of sedition as an excuse to attack people, the hatred of humans, he’s set up so much better as a villain than anyone before him.
               * I doubt Oda had come up with the meaning at the time but seeing the Sun Pirates tattoo on Arlong’s chest is jarring
               * I like that Usopp used to claim he had millions of followers but after meeting Krieg he says he has thousands. He updated his lie based on something more realistic. Even though Krieg only had a hundred fighters with him.
               * Chapter 73
               * I’m not sure what changed, but Hachi doesn’t quite look like he does later on
               * Though this isn’t the first appearance of a sea monster this may be the first official Sea King in Moomoo
               * So, I found some fan translations to parallel the Viz translations and Viz has been censoring the SBS. Though I could still identify it, the Japanese version explicitly asks if Luffy’s penis can stretch, there are several references to poop that get changed, yet the blood and violence of One Piece that doesn’t get touched.
               * Chapter 74
               * >Bragging about a 20 mil bounty
               * Arlong’s hat is weird. It looks like a warm winter hat but if you ever got that thing wet it would be miserable to have on
               * Chapter 75
               * Arlong’s fishmen have a lot of tattoos but only he and Hachi have the Sun Pirates tattoo. And there is a wide variety of tattoos too. It's not like there’s only 3 being passed around in different combinations, there’s the Arlong tattoo, a crab, various kanji, the Manji, yakuza swirls. I wonder if the Sun Pirates were already planned since Jinbe and the island itself have already been mentioned.
               * Pg 18 bottom panel, a truly bizarre translation. Arlong talks like this in Japan but they don’t adjust the what speech bubble is where to make it more English friendly so now he looks like he was about to say something and was cut off
               * Chapter 76
               * Sanji has the balls to mock Zoro for losing to Mihawk, after minutes earlier getting a lecture on how Mihawk is one of the most dangerous men in the entire world
               * I believe this is the first Zoro Sanji Rivalry panel. It isn’t really a rivalry yet, Sanji’s just an uptight ass at this point. He had a similar argument with Usopp earlier.                                                                    
                  * Chapter 77
                  * Belle-Mere has the worst haircut I’ve ever seen in anything ever
                  * ‘I wish I had been found by rich people’ Nami’s insatiable greed predates Arlong
                  * This chapter was a flashback and then it had a flashback to Belle-mere and then another flashback to Noriko finding Nami.
                  * Chapter 78
                  * So, I don’t understand the financial side of Arlong’s plan. He collected around 25mil his first night but he’s willing to sell Nami the village for 100mil. It’s stated that Arlong collects monthly but he couldn’t be collecting as much as he did because then his profits would outpace Nami’s bid in 4 months.
                  * Chapter 79
                  * She raised a thief and a coward                                                                                           
                  * Genzo establishes that the Grand Line Navy is on a different level
                  * If you can just survive, good times will come. It isn’t exact but it’s a bit like Binks
                     * Chapter 80
                     * The tip of Usopp’s nose is rounded but he still has nostrils
                     * I know that Nezumi is just doing dirty work for Arlong but he actually has an excellent point. Just because Nami stole from pirates doesn’t mean that the items were clean, they belonged to someone and the pirates stole from them. That someone deserves to have their stuff back and Nami really isn’t any better than the original thieves
                     * Nami admits to stealing
                     * If Genzo knows, why couldn’t they quickly scrape together 7mil and pay Arlong off earlier in this arc. They were able to pay 25mil earlier and even if this bankrupts them for a few months, so what? They wouldn’t have to pay and if the Arlong pirates attack anyway nothing would have mattered.
                     * Wow, in the first hundred chapters the marines have done nothing to redeem themselves. In this arc alone they have been shown to be either corrupt or ineffectual. The marines were always meant to be antagonists but not bad guys.
                     * Arlong is one of the greatest villains in the whole series, shame he got retconned
                     * Chapter 81
                     * The blood-stained money is a bit on the nose
                     * Why does Oda always draw feet with the toes curled
                     * What a way to end a volume
                     * 4/10/22 Volume 10
                     * Chapter 82
                     * SBS: first time somebody else opens the SBS
                     * Chapter 83
                     * We begin the Koby/Helmeppo cover story
                     * Sanji is stated to be pretty strong for a human, Germa was always the plan guys
                     * Can’t Luffy just stretch his arm to some far-off building and try to pull himself out that way
                     * This is the first time we actually see a DF user go into the water. Luffy says he feels like he’s losing his energy
                     * Chapter 84
                     * Noriko was shot in the stomach and is running around just fine
                     * Fishman Karate is introduced and Ray-dude is a 40th degree
                     * Hachi proclaims himself to be the 2nd best swordsman on fishman island. Though that seems like a joke if someone was legitimately the 2nd best athlete in their country that'd be something to proclaim. I don’t remember much of the fishman island arc but if there is a best swordsman there that’s a worldbuilding point for Oda.
                     *  SBS: ‘In this world there are certain unyielding truths that you simply cannot avert your eyes from’ -Oda
                     * Chapter 85
                     * I think it’s very strange that the Marines wouldn’t arrest Helmeppo after all the shit he pulled.
                     * What is Arlong doing right now? He seems to have vanished as soon as he threw Luffy in the water
                     * Zoro looks just like Mihawk in this panel                                                 
                     * Genzo and Noriko appear to have a telepathic conversation
                     * Hachi and Zoro compare sword weights when a heavier sword would actually be weaker
                        * Chapter 86
                        * Ray-man reiterates that Sanji’s ability to take punishment is unusual for a human
                        * Arlong is just content to lounge in the rubble. There’re a lot of Jirens in early One Piece, its weird
                        * Sanji beats the fishman by breathing on him
                        * Chapter 87
                        * ‘I think everything will be okay’ hard cut to Usopp dead on the ground
                        * This is a good moment for Usopp, it's entirely internal and because he’s surrounded himself with better people to aspire towards.
                        * Usopp still has nostrils
                        * Also, the fights in this volume are going rather quick compared to later in the series. Zoro and Sanji only take about a chapter each for their fight
                        *  SBS: Somebody suggested Luffy vore his enemies
                        * Chapter 88
                        * Arlong displays the fishman karate water splash attack but doesn’t cite it as fishman karate
                        * Sanji says that Arlong is strong for a fishman which might explain how Usopp of all people is able to beat Lips with a toy hammer
                        * Arlong continues to be a great villain by spelling out Nami’s struggle in this arc in a natural way
                        * Luffy explains that he can’t be bothered to move his body and there’s even a little ‘don’ to accentuate it
                        * Chapter 89
                        * I’ve always found it very strange, Arlong explains here that DFs lose their abilities when underwater but yet Luffy can stretch. If Buggy were in two halves and then both halves were submerged would you be able to pull one out and then he operates normally?
                        * Chapter 90
                        * I’ve mentioned it before, I’ll mention it again, we have yet another crew of villain pirates that treat each other like family. Unlike Kuro and Krieg, Arlong actually returns the affection
                        * I know we have as of now returned to this style of combat but why wasn’t Luffy doing stuff like this for most of the series.  
                        * Luffy exemplifies Usopp by his ability to tell lies … as opposed to his accuracy
                        * Also found my first ‘shishishi’ at some point I’ll look back and see if I can find another
                        * Despite Arlong’s constant bitching about how fishman are better and despite the fact that he is dressing down Luffy directly, Arlong never says anything along the lines of ‘you think you're better than me?’ which would kind of be appropriate from his later perspective of ‘Fishman don’t deserve to be slaves to humans’ if he falsely accused Luffy of having a need to be better than fishmen.
                           * 4/11/22 Volume 11
                           * Chapter 91
                           * Garp is name dropped in the cover story
                           * They fight
                           * No SBS this volume, instead diagrams of the Going Merry
                           * Chapter 92
                           * Garp’s first appearance, though he’s wearing a dog hat to hide his face
                           * How is Luffy stretching his fingers when they’re knit? The knitting makes sense because they can just be stretched into place but how he manages to spread them out when it’s clear his fingers aren’t holding on to each other is impossible. This must be proof that he was a Zoan the whole time
                           * Sanji says Arlong looks like a fishman gone berserk but he imagines a sea king. Could this be proof that the sea kings are in fact evolved fishmen, after all the mermaid princess rules over the sea kings as well
                           * Viz uses the sound effect they have been using to replace the ‘don’ for Arlong’s rage but it was a different sound effect in Japanese
                           * Again, Arlong comes very close to his retconned goals, he says that he will conquer the world. If he had said he would overthrow the world government or humanity it would have fit his later characterization
                           * Chapter 93
                           * Morgan gets a hit in on Garp while in handcuffs. It is very strange that the marines didn’t remove his ax when they captured him
                           * Arlong treats Nami like a pet and even tries to convince Luffy of what a great pet-owner he’ll be
                           * Arlong is easily the first threatening villain in the series but he comes off as slightly one-dimensional to me now, knowing how Oda tried to retroactively write him.
                           * If Arlong can tell when she’s drawing charts wrong, why does he need her in the first place? Moreover, how are they mapping underwater because Nami would be incapable of that
                           * Arlong’s nose was broken twice but it should have only been broken once and that used as the final shot of him for this arc
                           * Chapter 94
                           * I’m really annoyed that colored pages get lost to time. You can always tell when a page was originally colored and then monotonized because of its weird shading. Like I have ‘deluxe’ volumes of manga like Berserk that don’t have all their colored pages.
                           * Arlong’s nose-shaped flagstaff wasn’t also broken 2/10     
                           * Usopp no longer has nostrils
                           * Despite the fact that Nami no longer has a need for the money she still demands that Nezumi return the money that doesn’t belong to her in the first place. And as we are all aware her money angle becomes a running gag, so it is completely fair to say Nami is a greedy pirate
                           * Viz in their continued efforts to obscure everything great about the series mistranslate Sanji saying ‘he says you’ll get what you deserve’ into ‘he says something terrible will happen to you’
                           * Musician gag strikes again, also Zoro is hyped to be unlike normal people
                           * Snail phone is introduced
                           * Luffy’s bounty photo, but not his bounty, is added. Also, there isn’t a scene in this chapter of Usopp standing behind Luffy like he does in the picture, any time Usopp and Luffy are in the same panel Zoro and Sanji are closer than Usopp
                              * Chapter 95
                              * Chapter 96
                              * Navy HQ appears to be in Wano
                              * It is stated that the average bounty in the East is 3mil
                              * “We must nip this evil in the bud before it spreads”
                              * Viz why? orig:    viz:  
                              * Kuina returns
                              * Mihawk returns
                              * Shanks returns
                              * Also, I didn’t want to mention it then because of the funny number association, but chapter 69 was a huge chapter and now 96 is an equally huge chapter
                                 * Chapter 97
                                 * Nami steps out of a changing room wearing Robin’s cowboy costume minus the hat
                                 * Though I joke about Tashigi being Kuina there’s literally no way she could be, she’d remember Zoro in this scene, and even if you believe the amnesia BS how would her body get away from Zoro. And really, I don’t think Kuina would be opposed to using a sword to make money considering her dad owns a dojo
                                 * It is introduced here that swords have personalities. And I know that that wasn’t ‘revealed’ until chapter 900-some but that’s old Jap folklore so it was probably always the case
                                 * Alvida appears on the final panel. If you hadn’t been paying attention to the cover story, like me as a kid, you would have thought it an abrupt ending
                                 * Chapter 98
                                 * Alvida is doing the Boa Hancock thing of having a sex-magic fruit and having everyone ogle her and wanting to fuck Luffy
                                 * Nami noticed a change in the air long before Luffy’s attempted execution. If we’re to believe that Dragon caused the storm than he must have super advanced observation haki
                                 * Chapter 99
                                 * Ya know, if I saw a pirate declare himself as the next king of the pirates where the previous king of the pirates was executed and then he survived his execution, I’d maybe think that God has deemed this man to be the king of the pirates. But that’s just me. And Sanji apparently
                                 * Alas the volume has ended, but so far we have only seen Paramecia fruits and Smoker hasn’t had his fruit revealed yet, just the fact that he has one. I’m pretty sure Smoker explains that his fruit is a Logia but it could have matched the properties of the other fruits just fine, the only difference being that because he’s made of smoke things just go through him like swords through a Buggy.
                                 * Also, Smoker was hyped a lot in these past two chapters but he has already failed
                                 * 4/12/22 Volume 12
                                 * Chapter 100
                                 * This is the first volume to drop the East Blue headline and instead uses Baroque Works
                                 * Dragon says that being a pirate is not a bad idea next to the inherited will quote. He is likely referring to Luffy after just having seen him declare himself king of the pirates. Since Dragon’s goal is to overthrow the government, he is likely saying that being a pirate king could also end up at that place. To my knowledge Roger and Dragon have never met
                                 * When I was a kid, the rain always confused me. Why aren’t the DF users affected by it? I later justified to myself that it must be because it isn’t seawater, only to later learn that fresh water works just as well but you need to be submerged. But having been in a few hurricanes in my life I can tell you heavy enough rain is basically being submerged
                                 * If Alvida has no friction, how does she even keep her clothes on, are they just floating a millimeter of her body?
                                 * So far, the only difference between Smoker and the other 3 is that he can produce smoke
                                 * Introduction of sea stone, though with Buggy and Alvida a regular net would have been enough if you could get it closed around them
                                 * Luffy’s arm doesn’t stretch when Sanji is trying to go back and defend Tashigi, either Oda’s a hack or Sanji’s heart wasn’t in it                
                                 * Some interesting stuff happens with Smoker, for one he picks Luffy up with smoke. I’m not sure how smoke could get thick enough to do that but it does. Assuming the smoke is thick then picking Luffy up isn’t a mistake, plenty of people have done that without haki. Smoker also turns into smoke when Sanji kicks him. This is interesting because, again, this wouldn’t contradict the other DFs we’ve seen at this point, his body has become smoke so it will dissipate if you try to touch it. However, it is later retconned with Crocodile that Logias have to transform consciously. The term Logia has also not been stated. And lastly Oda is really hyping Smoker up, shame he just disappears.
                                 * Smoker asks why Dragon would help Luffy. We, the audience, hundreds of chapters later, understand that it’s because Luffy’s his son. However, Smoker doesn’t know that, and since he knows Dragon opposes him, why would he even ask. Surely ‘the enemy of my enemy’ would immediately occur to Smoker, he would assume that Dragon was just trying to fuck over the government. Why would Smoker assume that Dragon would fight against a pirate?
                                 * Could Alvida even get wet? Surely since her skin is frictionless the water would just not touch her
                                 * Usopp’s nose is now full cartoon
                                 * With East Blue officially over I just want to praise how efficient it was. In the same span as Dressrosa we had 4 crewmates, 7 major locations, introductions to Devil Fruits, Fishman, the Grand Line, the Red Line, Shichibukai, the marines, Inherited Will, bounties, and probably more.
                                    * Chapter 101
                                    * Interesting how the canals on Reverse Mountain create an X.
                                    * The Grand Line flows south-east
                                    * Luffy says the mountain must be magic
                                    * Nami mentions, but doesn’t elaborate, that Reverse Mountain is a winter island. Interestingly she identifies Reverse Mountain and not the Red Line, which is consistent with the later explanation that the Red Line is several islands fused together
                                    * Chapter 102
                                    * It’s a pretty good introduction to the Grand Line that a whale minding its own business completely bodies the Strawhats
                                    * This is the first instance I’ve noticed of that bizarre paneling where Oda draws a regular panel and then chops it up into smaller panels                        
                                    * Something I forgot was that Crocus kills a giant squid like it’s nothing. Makes sense considering he’s a Roger pirate
                                       * Chapter 103
                                       * Knowing that Crocus knows about the One Piece really changes the meaning of, “That wall separates the oceans.” He calls it a ‘wall’ not a mountain or a continent
                                       * Crocus takes two bazooka blasts at once. Must be using haki
                                       * Interesting that island whales are only in the West Blue because we see some after fishman island. However, that’s the side of the Red Line the West Blue is on. It’s still a little weird because the whales are in the Grand Line, but from a whale’s perspective the West Blue, New World and North Blue are probably all the same thing.
                                       * The Rumbar Pirates were trying to circumnavigate years before Roger. Hey look it’s Brook                                                                   
                                       * Crocus neglects mentioning that he abandoned Laboon for a while there to sail with the Roger Pirates
                                          * Chapter 104
                                          * Crocus mentions he served ‘a crew for a few years’
                                          * I think Vivi’s face is drawn differently as Ms. Wednesday
                                          * Putting this aside for later                                                          
                                          * The Log Pose is introduced
                                          * Crocus believes, ‘from a reliable source’ that the Rumbar Pirates fled the Grand Line, but we know that isn’t true and there shouldn’t be a source out there that can give that false explanation
                                          * Early on, Luffy has a pattern of helping people by being, seemingly, cruel to them only to reveal that he’s a good person. He did this with Koby, Gaimon and now Laboon
                                             * Chapter 105
                                             * Nami hit Luffy, ‘just cause’ adding domestic abuser to her list of fundamental character flaws
                                             * The 7 magnetic paths and the end of the Grand Line are mentioned. Interestingly the anime pronounces the final island as ‘Raftel’ as opposed to its correct pronunciation
                                             * Usopp asks if the One Piece is on Raftel and Crocus hits them with the ‘maybe’
                                             * And, of course, the prophecy bit  
                                                * Chapter 106
                                                * Glad to see the Grand Line giving it to the Strawhats a little. Wouldn’t want them to just steamroll it
                                                * And now Nami can’t even navigate, put that on the list. Robin is best
                                                * Chapter 107
                                                * Igaram mentions that there is a 30% loss on bounties if the pirate is handed in dead. But the posters literally say “Dead or Alive” on them
                                                * First mention of Baroque Works
                                                * I find it hilarious that the cactus rocks are just normal rocks with a bunch of manmade spikes on them
                                                * Chapter 108
                                                * Zoro calls Kitetsu III a problem child
                                                * Zoro causes Ms. Monday to foam from the mouth. Must be Conqueror’s
                                                * 4/13/22 Volume 13
                                                * Chapter 109
                                                * Oda’s volume intro refers to dragons as ‘living beings closest to god’
                                                * I’ve always thought that ‘red-haired’ Shanks was kind of a weird epithet but I just realized there was a real Viking named Erik the Red who was named for his red hair
                                                * SBS: The question about ripped pants from transformations appears
                                                * Chapter 110
                                                * Don’t know why Viz decided to change Baroque’s motto to ‘mystery’ ‘secrecy’ makes a lot more sense and is way more intimidating
                                                * Viz also felt the need to explain that Igaram is his real name in the middle of a scene where it’s explained that people have infiltrated Baroque
                                                * I mentioned before that up until this point Devil Fruits have all followed the central rule of ‘turning the body into X’ but this is the point where that rule no longer applies. Ms. Valentine and Mr. 5 don’t actually break the rule but they are stretching it. Previously all DF users appeared normal until you interacted with their bodies in which case their bodies would react bizarrely. Valentine specifically can turn her power on and off which we haven’t yet seen. I know there’s some funny business with Logias coming up but at the moment Smoker still followed the initial rule. Mr. 5 creates a whole mess of problems because he'd technically be awakened. Mr. 5 can turn his boogers into bombs but I wouldn’t really count those as part of his body. By the same logic as the booger-bombs he should also be able to turn his piss into bombs.
                                                * Chapter 111
                                                * Adding alcoholic to Nami’s character sheet
                                                * Yes, even excluding the hair, Vivi is drawn differently. Her eyes are different colors and her eyebrows are thinner                                                                                     
                                                * Wow, the Zoro-Luffy fight is even less justified than I remembered. I remembered Luffy at least wandered around and saw all the dead bodies and was pissed because he didn’t understand the context. No, turns out he sees Zoro defending a woman from two people he’s never seen before and assumes that his friend that he’s spent over a hundred chapters with is the bad guy. And then Luffy’s words imply that this is just another instance of a long running problem he’s had with Zoro and now Luffy’s finally snapped
                                                   * Chapter 112
                                                   * Oh wait, it was like I remembered, the event just wasn’t shown last chapter. It’s still stupid
                                                   * Valentine can fly when she weighs one kilo. I happen to know that objects that are one kilo are still affected by gravity as evidenced by this piece of paper on my desk that is definitely less than two pounds and isn’t flying away
                                                   * I really don’t like that Zoro and Luffy take out 5 and Valentine like nothing. I realize that they take on people way stronger than these two in Alabasta and there’s no training arc between now and then, but I don’t think it’s good for the Grand Line that everyone being thrown at these two so far have been easily defeated
                                                   * Chapter 113
                                                   * Luffy’s laugh here is ‘Nahaha’. Luffy has many different laughs like some kind of boy with many joys
                                                   * Oh no a whole 80 million
                                                   * Eternal Poses are introduced
                                                   * There was a page cut from chapter 98 where Usopp buys his new goggles in Lougetown
                                                   * Chapter 114
                                                   * Baroque only has 2,000 members, that’s less than half of Krieg’s armada
                                                   * Robin makes her first appearance
                                                   * Sanji points a gun at a woman
                                                   * I don’t think Robin’s powers have been figured out yet because there is no way she could have grabbed Luffy’s hat without her power being seen. There was a scene early on with Buggy where Buggy was choking a guy from afar but his hand was strategically hidden so that you couldn’t tell it was chopped. Here that’s not the case, you see Luffy’s hat fly through the air and you don’t see Robin sprouting an arm to reach out and grab it, nor do you see an arm sprout on top of Luffy’s head to throw it.
                                                   * I wish there were more interactions with Vivi like this. The Strawhats, at the moment, are victims of circumstance and have to help Vivi. If they warmed to her over time that would be nice but as far as I remember she just fits in immediately                                                                            
                                                   * I know that this is meant to imply the presence of giants but I really wish it implied that it was an island of tiny beasts  
                                                      * Chapter 115
                                                      * Writing down Louis Arnot because I think he also did the Skypiea quote but I forget and I’m not gonna check
                                                      * Chapter 116
                                                      * Elbaf is mentioned for the first time
                                                      * Luffy gets along very well with Dorry. I’ve heard theories about how Nika is specifically a sun god for the giants and the fact that Luffy gets along instantly could be considered evidence for that. Luffy actually doesn’t get along with lots of people when they meet, Zoro Nami and Sanji being obvious examples
                                                      * Interesting, Dorry refers to a god but Viz translates this as ‘God of Elbaf’ while the fan scans call it ‘the God Elbaf’. I don’t know which it is and raws are a pain to find if they aren’t current
                                                      * Dorry says that he’s been fighting for a hundred years but then justifies it by saying giants live three times as long as humans so it’s not that bad. That’s still equivalent to thirty years which is longer than WW1 and WW2 combined
                                                      * Chapter 117
                                                      * 4/14/22 Volume 14
                                                      * Chapter 118
                                                      * I’m noticing that Shanks keeps getting an intro in the volume character Bios but he rarely appears or is mentioned
                                                      * Mr. 5 put a bomb in Dorry’s ale. His piss really was explosive
                                                      * SBS: Mirrorball Island is introduced. For those who don’t know that’s a location in the Django cover story
                                                      * Chapter 119
                                                      * Interestingly, Viz is now translating ‘the god, Elbaf’
                                                      * Zoro is lost for the first time
                                                      * Mr. 3 can make wax just appear on the ground right where he needs it to. I think that breaks some rule


                                                      * Chapter 120
                                                      * Vivi pulls two spikes out of her nipples  
                                                      * Mr. 3, in fact, does not have the wax fruit but the candle fruit which is why his hair can burn. He should also have some scent related abilities but he doesn’t use any
                                                         * Chapter 121
                                                         * Valentine says Luffy is weak but apparently doesn’t notice that he’s trapped under a mountain and not dead
                                                         * I’m surprised Brogy isn’t saying that Dorry wasn’t protected by the gods or whatever. It seems like their belief system would make it so that others couldn’t interfere in the battles and any interference was divine will
                                                         * It is impossible to tell how much is planned in One Piece  
                                                            * Chapter 122
                                                            * Mr. 3 is a complete psychopath, imagine Luffy allying with that guy
                                                            * Chapter 123
                                                            * Nami worries about Zoro’s leg but wouldn’t the wax seal that up just fine
                                                            * Chapter 124
                                                            * Is it just me or are Mr. 5 and Ms. V constantly giving out vital information?
                                                            * Ms. GW has the second form of hypnosis in the series. I actually forgot this was a hypnosis ability so I want to try and see if there are any further hypnosis abilities later on
                                                            * Mr. 5’s breath being explosive breaks so many rules
                                                            * Chapter 125
                                                            * I know the Wax-mech is only painted but it reminds me of armament haki
                                                            * Everyone at Baroque seems to have loose lips. How is this place’s motto ‘secrecy’?
                                                            * Ms. V decides to sit on Usopp’s crotch and apply pressure
                                                            * Chapter 126
                                                            * Mr. 5 is burning. Since his body’s a bomb shouldn’t he just constantly explode until the fire’s out?
                                                            * 4/15/22 Volume 15
                                                            * Chapter 127
                                                            * The giants are on the cover but Little Garden is basically over. Vol 14 and 15 could have switched covers and nothing would be lost
                                                            * Japanese volume 15 has pandaman on the front cover
                                                            * Another note about Elbaf and gods is that it’s unclear how many there are. Viz and fan scans disagree on a translation meaning one God or a pantheon. This has occurred more than once
                                                            * So apparently transponder snails can have their communications intercepted. I wonder if they can encrypt the snails somehow
                                                            * Chapter 128
                                                            * Interesting that there was at one-point specialized transponder snails
                                                            * The duck has teeth. I just googled it and apparently that’s normal, in fact ducks have teeth on their tongues
                                                            * I’m sure this will be resolved later, but even if the Strawhats go to Alabasta, their Log Pose will still be set to Little Garden. I’ll have to remember to call Oda a hack if there isn’t a panel of somebody handing Nami a new one at the end of Alabasta
                                                            * Luffy’s rippling muscles really don’t match his cartoon face. It looks like his head is growing out of a rock or something                                         
                                                               * Chapter 129
                                                               * Usopp calls back to his own fables about giant goldfish. Brogy cites how big its poop is
                                                               * Only the ‘Great Serpent Soaked in Blood’ can withstand our attacks. Is that some reference to Jörmungandr?
                                                               * I’m beginning to wonder if the sea kings are natural entities. It is widely believed that the Red Line is artificial and I’ve seen theories that the Grand Line is also artificial. Since Sea Kings are primarily found in the Grand Line and are associated with an ancient weapon, why wouldn’t they be artificial?
                                                               * Zoro begins training to shatter steel. Only problem is that he has his weights all on one end of his stick as opposed to spread across the stick. That isn’t a joke, training like that will cause him to treat his sword like a mace.
                                                               * I wonder why Viz didn’t want to translate Okama I wonder how they’ll handle future translations
                                                               * SBS: Apparently the bottle didn’t break when the Merry was christened
                                                               * Chapter 130
                                                               * Neither Sanji, nor Usopp, nor Luffy have ever been sick. Sanji’s the only one with an excuse
                                                               * Only a million? That’s kinda small for the population of a country
                                                               * It’s weird that Nami is pushing so hard to get to Alabasta, from her perspective the crisis is averted, Crocodile thinks she’s dead
                                                               * So, their plan is to just sail aimlessly and hope they find a doctor?
                                                               * SBS: Mention of a Kappa. I don’t think that has anything to do with a future Kappa but it was mentioned and Oda did choose to put that letter in the SBS
                                                               * Chapter 131
                                                               * SBS: So apparently Zeff eating his own leg was removed from the Japanese anime adaptation. 4kidz wasn’t even the first
                                                               * Chapter 132
                                                               * The concept of seasonal islands is explained. Nami introduced this at Reverse Mountain but Vivi explains further. There are also sub-seasons so you could end up with a double-winter or a spring-fall.
                                                               * Chapter 133
                                                               * I didn’t see anyone actually call the place Drum Island. I only bring this up because the first mention appears to be in Dalton’s nametag
                                                               * Luffy got a sword from somewhere
                                                               * OH shit it’s the Blackbeard Pirates. And for once the silhouettes look accurate. But it begs the question, what were they doing out here? Wasn’t Whitebeard stationed in the New World and didn’t BB immediately flee after killing Teach
                                                               * Chapter 134
                                                               * Oh shit, the Reverie is mentioned. Not by name, it’s called ‘a meeting of kings’ and Vivi went there and met Wapol there
                                                               * I know that Vivi is ‘the good royalty’ trope but it's completely ridiculous that she isn’t aware of the fact that 95% of royalty in this world are complete shit. Usopp even looks at her with confusion about the idea that ‘a king wouldn’t abandon his people’
                                                               * Luffy mentions something about people not sleeping because they’ll die. Blackbeard doesn’t sleep and he was just introduced
                                                               * Chopper’s intro. Who’d have thought between the reindeer and the 140-year-old doctor the reindeer would be more important
                                                               * Chapter 135
                                                               * First Zoan. No, I’m not counting the Nika Nika. Zoans actually follow the body rule better than paramecia.
                                                               * Chapter 136
                                                               * First time Zoans are mentioned by name, still waiting on Logia and Paramecia


                                                               * 4/16/22 Volume 16

                                                               * Shouldn’t being caught in an avalanche be just as bad for a DF user as falling in the ocean? They’re both being submerged in water
                                                               * Chapter 138

                                                               * Zoro got lost but it almost makes sense here, it’s not played like a gag
                                                               * Who would have thought Nami’s thottery would be plot relevant                          
                                                                  * Chapter 140

                                                                  * It’s weird to see Chopper get angry about anything
                                                                  * SBS: Somebody asks Oda if they eat Luffy will they become a rubber-man. Oda says no but of course the answer is yes, we know because that happens later on. Oda must have gotten thousands of letters even back then, less than 5 years in. I wonder if he doesn’t purposely put spoilers that seem absurd in. Luffy’s Penis actually did show up and stretched in Amazon Lily
                                                                  * Chapter 141

                                                                     * Chapter 142

                                                                     * Tragic ‘push them away for their own good’ moment
                                                                     * Chapter 143

                                                                     * I’ve heard people say that the ‘land of cherry blossoms’ Dr. Hiriluk found was Wano but I’m not so sure. The island the doctor mentions is always stated to be to the west and, for a pirate, the route to Wano would be south-east
                                                                     * I wonder if what cured Dr. Hiriluk the first time was a form of hypnotism
                                                                     * Wapol’s right, Dr. Hiriluk is a thief and an arsonist and he’s endangered many people with his bad medicine. He really should be arrested if nothing else
                                                                     * Chapter 144

                                                                     * He poured his explosive liquid into a sake cup
                                                                     * ‘No medicine can cure stupidity’ -Dalton
                                                                     * Was that entire scene a flash back for Wapol? That’d be weird considering there was a bunch of things he wasn’t there for. And it’s weird how its spliced between Luffy throwing his punch and the impact implying that this is some big culmination for Luffy despite the fact that nothing in that flashback involved him
                                                                     * 4/17/22 Volume 17

                                                                     * On a cover page Oda draws Chopper with the Strawhats but not Vivi
                                                                     * Kuromarimo manages to have weird static powers without a DF. It is strange how Oda used to just have people do stuff but now everything is a DF
                                                                     * Chapter 147
                                                                     * Wapol’s fruit has some parallels with Bege’s fruit
                                                                     * It’s really weird seeing chopper with any form of agency or anger after decades of him being a mascot
                                                                     * Chapter 148

This is actually kind of neat because we are right off of Little Garden and Usopp is now trying to point himself towards being a ‘warrior’ but his crewmate undermines him. Zoro didn’t even need to do this since some villagers say they have another way up the mountain
                                                                     *                                                                        * SBS: Oda says that Sea Kings and Sea Monsters are in fact different. He even specifies that the Cow Sea Monster from Arlong Park is a sea mammal. I wish I could find a raw or fanscan of this SBS
                                                                        * Chapter 149

                                                                        * I’m sure I’m not the only person to say this but has Chopper ever tried to experiment with Rumble Balls on the other types of DFs? Also, it ‘disrupts the waves given off by the Devil Fruit’ but how does that even work, I thought DFs modified the user’s genetics
                                                                        * This fight is more like an interview for Chopper
                                                                        * Chapter 150

                                                                        * I wish Wapol would suddenly turn back into his original form and go, ‘oh no! my body must have finished digesting that stuff I ate!’
                                                                        * Chapter 151

                                                                        * Luffy seems to use Gum-Gum Bazooka as a finisher more than any other technique
                                                                        * Chapter 152

                                                                        * Chapter 153

                                                                        * Chopper’s issues weren’t really resolved with the cherry blossom thing. It’s not like he was sick and cured and such, and it’s not like he stopped believing in Hiriluk. In fact, they had to throw a sudden line of doubt in 1 page before this scene.
                                                                        * Chapter 154

                                                                        * It really is a tragedy that the fan scans are so bad for this arc because I really don’t trust Viz and though it sounds really janky in English, I’d like to see a straight Japanese translation
                                                                        * Does Chopper use the talking-to-animals power ever again? I imagine he’ll use it in the next arc or two and then Oda will forget
                                                                        * These translations really encapsulate my problems with Viz and the fanscans

He used to hang out with cross-dressers and now, when he has his own organization his second closest associate is also a cross-dresser who can change his face into any man Croc wishes
                                                                           * 4/18/22 Volume 18

                                                                           * Bon Clay needs to smack people in the face to steal their face. I’ll have to remember that when we get to Wano
                                                                           * It’s also pretty cool how Oda drew Bon Clays eyebrow and mouth expressions onto Luffy’s face to show it was Bon Clay pretending to be Luffy
                                                                           * Remember when Luffy was straight? Oda doesn’t. Also, Oda’s explanation later on is that Luffy was just playing along but in this panel, you can see that Chopper is marked off with an ‘?’ but Luffy is exactly like Usopp  
                                                                           * SBS: Dr. Kureha’s secret of youth is being happy. She does like to laugh and drink sake. Also, I realized that Kureha probably met Roger considering Roger followed the same path the Strawhats do. They’ve both been to Skypiea
                                                                              * Chapter 157

                                                                              * Bon Clay turned into Chopper while Chopper was in his hybrid form, does that mean Bon Clay could copy other Zoan forms?
                                                                              * I wonder if at one point Ace was intended to be Luffy’s biological brother because they look pretty similar and he has a lot of the same mannerisms and comedic poses as Luffy. But then again, they have different Last names in this first appearance
                                                                              * First mention of the Yonko Whitebeard. No mention of the concept of the Yonko

                                                                              * When I saw Ms. Doublefinger for the first time, I actually thought she was Robin from Whisky Peak and that Robin talking to Crocodile all the time was a completely different character
                                                                              * Chapter 161

                                                                              * I wonder if Mr. 1 is a member of the long-finger tribe
                                                                              * I wonder if we know what ‘the country where it never rains’ is

                                                                              * Chapter 162

                                                                              *                                                                                    * Chapter 163

Doffy’s plan was to force the king to attack his citizens which he did but the whole time the king was literally crying and telling people to run. I’m not sure what is considered common knowledge of Devil Fruits in the New World, but I think if you saw your king running around, begging to not attack people, you might think something is amiss. Doffy’s angle with Sugar’s powers also helped a lot. Croc, on the other hand, spent a decade slowly building himself up while subtly using his powers to affect the weather towards his ends. Everything would have worked out perfectly except for the fact that Robin didn’t want him to win. Could he have maneuvered around that, maybe I’ll decide once I’ve read it again, but Croc’s plan was pretty air tight. Another thing Doffy had that Croc didn’t was nakama. My point is that the two are often compared but their personalities, strategies, power levels, and goals are very different from one another and even though they both tried to take over a country, they really don’t parallel each other much
                                                                                 * I wonder if the name of Koza’s Sand-Sand group is foreshadowing. So far, it’s the only thing I’ve seen that isn’t directly related to a fruit with that double word naming convention
                                                                                 * Chapter 164
                                                                                 * Chapter 165
                                                                                 * I never really noticed that Usopp calls everyone else on the crew a monster: Zoro, Chopper, Luffy, Sanji
                                                                                 * So, what is an assassin exactly? Though the distinction isn’t used in One Piece the pirates of the world are obviously divided into Peacemains and Morganeers. All these assassins act really confused about Croc being their boss but he’s a textbook Morganeer and I don’t think assassins would have a problem with Morganeers. Ms. Double says she’s confused because he’s a Shichibukai but I figure the average assassin would be cynical enough to say, ‘the 7 are just in it for the money, as soon as something better happens, they’ll betray the government’. And I don’t think this is supposed to surprise the audience because we’ve known Croc’s a bad dude before we knew he was a shichibukai
                                                                                 * Chapter 166

                                                                                 * 4/19/22 Volume 19

If he was stealing water and, because towns are drying up left and right, taking water from new sources every time, wouldn’t his capital be flooded. There was a point in Alabasta where it rained rarely but evenly, if all the water was supposedly being siphoned to one place, wouldn’t that one place be flooded from overabundance?
                                                                                 * Would an originally human Zoan user be able to talk to an animal if they transformed into that animal?

                                                                                 * Zoro managed to get to the casino very quickly

                                                                                 * Chapter 169

                                                                                 * ‘Five flying devil fruits’ Obviously Pell counts himself among these 5, but what other 4 he was referring to I have no idea. Let’s make a rule where a devil fruit only flies if that is its obvious power. This rule excludes Doffy swinging from clouds or Ace rocketing himself. I think we could reasonably add Shiki, Marco and Morgans but after that you start to get unsure. It’s not as if Pell referred to the five bird Zoans; the literal translation is ‘flying powers’. I doubt he was referring to people we’ve seen up until now because the only two you could add are Smoker and Ace but then who are the other two? You could stretch it a little and say Buggy but that still leaves one slot open and nobody else flies. This line confused me so much it has stuck in my brain for over a decade and I still don’t have an answer

How it works has never made any sense to me, I wouldn’t be surprised if it was revealed later on it wasn’t the flower fruit at all it was the grafting fruit or something. Also, since it’s a Paramecia it must be awakened since she can flower her body parts on things other than her body
                                                                                 * Why doesn’t Robin spawn her limbs inside people and rip them apart from the inside? It’d be faster
                                                                                 * Crocodile’s head getting blown apart makes me wonder

                                                                                 * I know there was a little kid but did nobody in the crowd notice that the king suddenly turned into somebody else?

                                                                                 * That’s a good line

                                                                                       * SBS: A half explanation about where the name Baroque Works comes from

                                                                                       *                                                                                          * They say it’s a dachshund fruit but Lassoo looks more like a golden retriever to me

                                                                                             * If Nami really got spiked through the leg like that she’d never walk again
                                                                                             * That’s not how mirages work

                                                                                             * Robin’s fruit apparently also gives super strength since she can just throw grown men, in armor, with one hand each
                                                                                             * Also, the men with bladed weapons on sticks can’t figure out how to attack the hands without getting grabbed
                                                                                             * First mention of the ancient weapons, also Vivi doesn’t know what Croc is talking about but Chaka does
                                                                                             * In yet another example of non-Luffy toon powers, Ms. Cone-tits does a Popeye to her arms
                                                                                             * Interesting translation issue about the Popeye attack, in Kanji this attack is called ‘acupuncture’, but Oda purposefully gave it a furigana reading of ‘doping’. That makes it really unclear what is supposed to be happening with this attack since neither of those methods have these results. Another oddity is that the fruit shouldn’t encompass either of those needles since the fruits name refers more to thorns and bristles than medical needles
                                                                                             * Chapter 193

                                                                                             * Croc explicitly says Pluton carries the name of a god. This is interesting because most in-universe lore is basically our own, hence mythical Zoans. The only problem is that one exception which nobody has been able to find an equivalent for. The best I’ve heard so far is the Hindu god Agni but that’s still not quite right because that religion has the Wisdom Kings Hyogoro was referring to but Agni isn’t one of them, among other issues
                                                                                             * First mention of Poneglyphs
                                                                                             * Boy, it sure would be a problem if less than 20% of the way though the story a main character already overcame their biggest hurdle for the entire story
                                                                                             * Chapter 194

                                                                                             * Chapter 195

Zoro must have the voice of all things because he can hear his sword under the rubble. Zoro has advanced armament because he can cut steel
                                                                                             * Zoro comments that his heartbeat is ‘like a drum’ and the sound effect is the same as when Luffy awakens but not the same as the ‘drums of liberation’ sound.
                                                                                             * Zoro claims to be able to hear rocks, trees, and the earth itself ‘breathing’
                                                                                             * That’s how he can cut steel, by hearing its breath
                                                                                             * 4/22/22 Volume 22

                                                                                             * Chaka gets madder at Croc because Croc doesn’t want to waste energy on people that are literally killing themselves
                                                                                             * Mr. 1 asks if Zoro will cut diamonds next. Even Mihawk couldn’t cut that diamond guy at the war
                                                                                             * Chapter 197

                                                                                             * I’m surprised Croc didn’t try to pretend he was on the side of the rebellion and say he was also here to stop the king who had clearly lost his mind.
                                                                                             * According to Chaka, the jackal is a guardian deity of Alabasta, so why isn’t it a mythical Zoan?
                                                                                             * Chapter 198

                                                                                             * Chapter 199

                                                                                             * This looks familiar

                                                                                                * Luffy declares himself the eighth warlord of the sea
                                                                                                * Luffy’s first transformation: Water Luffy
                                                                                                * Well, that was a pretty uneventful chapter overall but since we are now in the 200s I’d figure I’d do a quick recap of the last hundred. One Piece is still moving at a good pace, in the last hundred we’ve been to Reverse Mountain, Whisky Peak, Little Garden, Drum Island, and Alabasta. We learned about Raftel and a lot about the Grand Line. We’ve met a Shichibukai, Giants, a Roger pirate, the Rumbar pirates, Blackbeard pirates, Whitebeard pirates, Elbaf has been introduced, and this was all done in a little over 2 years. I think at the moment there aren’t Logia fruits, I think Oda is thinking of them as ‘trained paramecia’ more than their own thing. The term ‘Paramecia’ hasn’t been used either. And with this cover pages Cammy has already been introduced and sold into slavery foreshadowing
                                                                                                * Chapter 201
                                                                                                * I thought for a second that Croc had used awakened-tier powers
                                                                                                * Has Tashigi ever accomplished anything?
                                                                                                * Chapter 202
                                                                                                * Remember when Luffy had to employ strategy to defeat his opponents? You know, actually I think strategy is the exception not the rule. Arlong, Luffy was stronger and hit him really hard. Krieg, Luffy was stronger and hit him really hard. Buggy was actually defeated by tying his limbs together but that wasn’t Luffy’s idea. Wapol, Luffy hit really hard. Next, we have Jaya where the entire payoff is that Luffy only needs to hit the guy once to win. After that is Enel, which I don’t remember most of but I know Luffy didn’t even understand how he hard-countered Enel. Enel employed more strategy by restarting his own heart. I don’t want to go through everyone and I know there are some strategies later but I think Luffy punching hard is the most common win condition.                 
                                                                                                * Luffy purposefully missed with the water to revive himself from Croc’s attack
                                                                                                * Interesting that Luffy passes out from blood loss and is confused because the meat should have healed him. Just making a note of this incase it is ever stated that Luffy’s body works off JRPG logic and all his wounds will auto-heal when he eats enough random food
                                                                                                * First appearance of a Poneglyph
                                                                                                * Does Robin have to touch the Poneglyph to read them? I’ll try to keep track but I’m pretty sure she rubs her hands on them every time she reads one. God imagine if that was a requirement and that rubbing of Big Mom’s was completely useless
                                                                                                * Chapter 203
                                                                                                * I don’t think Croc knows there’s more than one Poneglyph, if he did, he wouldn’t try to kill Robin. But also, at this moment Croc’s lost. Croc was hedging his bet on finding Pluton and even said that he needed it to stop the inevitable government intervention that would come as a result of his actions in Alabasta. He should be running, not trying to kill Robin, she can’t reveal any more information than anyone else who’s there at this point since he had his big villain speech and told everyone his plan
                                                                                                * 12th? That’s not that many, like if you assume an average rule of like 65 years that means the kingdom has only been around for 780 years … wait
                                                                                                * Dropping a ceiling on him wouldn’t hurt Croc since he can just turn into sand, however Croc should be trying to save Cobra right now since (from his perspective) he’s the only one that can give him the weapon he needs to fight the WG
                                                                                                * Zoro managed to get lost out of the city. And soon he will get lost exactly where he needs to go
                                                                                                * Chapter 204
                                                                                                * I wonder if this chapter was named after the One Piece movie
                                                                                                * I remember, many years ago, talking to a friend who was getting into One Piece and we were talking about this scene where Luffy is using his blood to punch Croc. He asked me, ‘Does One Piece ever get that metal again?’
                                                                                                * Croc says that once the ceiling collapses they’ll both be defeated but both of them have DFs that would protect them from getting crushed
                                                                                                * This is the second opponent Luffy has faced who uses poison
                                                                                                * Chapter 205

                                                                                                * 4/23/22 Volume 23

                                                                                                * Chapter 208

We are now far from where we started and are into the ‘proper’ One Piece. The story is focused on the world and the people within it rather than gags and weirdness. Not that gags and weirdness are suddenly gone for good, Luffy did find Croc because a staircase looked ‘Crocodile-ish’. This was certainly the longest section of the story to date, as I was reviewing my notes to try and find an earlier mosshead gag I noticed Drum Island ended at about 150 meaning we’ve been in Alabasta for over fifty chapters. It didn’t really feel too long to me, the only part that felt like it dragged was when the Strawhats paired off against BW agents. Turns out I was wrong, Luffy did just hit Croc really hard, as soon as he could punch that’s the only thing he did. No explanation was given about the poison Luffy just tanked it. 1047 came out yesterday. In it, Kaido claims that Roger conquered the world using only Haki. Reading these old chapters, it is very obvious Haki wasn’t a thing yet so I wonder what, if anything, was the first explanation of Roger’s prowess. Maybe it’s like that mermaid thing from earlier in this volume where Oda had an idea and then adjusted it later on. Anyway, Alabasta also didn’t feel that long to me because I’ve been pacing myself to a volume a day so I don’t really get sick of what I’m reading. I’m not sure how that will hold up when we get to Dressrosa but for now its working pretty ok.
                                                                                                * Chapter 212
                                                                                                * I understand the WG position about who killed Croc, but wasn’t the whole idea behind the Shichibukai that they could turn pirates into heroes? Why would they be mad that pirates saved Alabasta when the Strawhats greatest crime up to this point was that their captain attacked a corrupt marine captain. I don’t think Wapol has filed a complaint yet, he hasn’t had his cover story
                                                                                                * And Smoker faced no consequences for insubordination
                                                                                                * Chapter 213
                                                                                                * Cobra tells Sanji where Vivi is bathing, knowing Sanji’s intention is to perv
                                                                                                * Bounty increase, not really sure why Zoro was the only one to get one here, the Strawhats did a pretty even sweep of the agents
                                                                                                * Also, Igaram claims admirals will be after Luffy but not really, there’s way higher bounties out there, and the only Admiral that goes after Luffy was Kizaru but that was in response to the Celestial Dragons not the bounty.
                                                                                                * Chapter 214

                                                                                                * What a good ending to a volume
                                                                                                * 4/24/22 Volume 24

                                                                                                * This volume ends the Baroque Works headline and switches to Skypiea instead
                                                                                                * SBS: some details on Marine uniforms
                                                                                                * Chapter 218
                                                                                                * So, the Poneglyph only had info on the weapon specs and location. I’ve heard a theory that since Poseidon can control the Sea Kings, the Pluton must be able to control land animals, and the Uranus controls sky creatures like dragons. I noticed many animals were fond of Vivi this past arc
                                                                                                * More importantly there is a huge info dump on Poneglyphs. First, they actually have normal names but Oda gave them special furigana pronunciations like with the ‘doping’ attack earlier. Poneglyphs are literally named ‘historical texts’ and the Rio Poneglyph is named ‘true historical text’. I actually thought that the Rio and Road Poneglyphs were the same until just now. Now I think the Rio Poneglyph must be on Raftel and part of the One Piece. Wonder why Oda named it ‘Rio’ Viz seems to think it’s a transliteration of ‘Real’ but I’m not sure. But the idea that it’s the Spanish word for river doesn’t make a ton of sense either
                                                                                                * Robin has her first ‘Just let me die’ moment and Luffy tells her to shut up
                                                                                                * Turns out this quote wasn’t by Louis Arnot, it was by Willy Gallon. How much you wanna bet he was the guy who invented DFs or some such nonsense
                                                                                                * I like this scene; it helps sell that there is still mystery and danger in the Grand Line even though we’ve now been in the Grand Line longer than East Blue. It bucks familiarity
                                                                                                * SBS: A viewer identifies Mr. 3 walking free in Alabasta, in fact he’s shown outside Rainsdish listening to Vivi’s speech
                                                                                                * Chapter 219
                                                                                                * Interesting that Robin knows about Sky-islands at all. I wonder where she learned about them from. Certainly not Croc his powers and outlook would completely clash with going to a sky-island ever
                                                                                                * This Masira fellow has no ape devil fruit, somehow
                                                                                                * Chapter 220

                                                                                                * Chapter 221
                                                                                                * The size scaling in this double page is amazing. You know the Merry, you’re used to the Merry so this new ship shows up and it dwarfs the Merry. And then this giant sea turtle shows up and dwarfs that new ship, and then the shadows appear and now the sea turtle is dwarfed. At the range they’re at I’m surprised they can even make out what the shadows are
                                                                                                * Chapter 222
                                                                                                * So, this octopus had been hanging onto Zoro since they dived. I admit I got a little attached and was slightly distressed when they decided to turn it into food
                                                                                                * Van Augur is the first Blackbeard pirate to make an appearance, which is odd because I’m pretty sure he doesn’t play a major part in this story
                                                                                                * Jesus also appears before the big man himself
                                                                                                * Like the other fictional quotes there is another one describing Mock Town, but for some reason Viz translated the name as ‘Jew Wall’
                                                                                                * Chapter 223
                                                                                                * Wow, every Blackbeard pirate is getting an introduction, but at the same time Oda isn’t giving them anything to signal them out, no name cards, no iconography, nothing.
                                                                                                * Of course, I knew the Bellamy pirates were a subsidy of the Don Quixote pirates but I thought they joined later in the story. Doffy hasn’t even been introduced in the story yet and Bellamy’s second is wearing Don Quixote merch
                                                                                                * So, this whole arc is kind of based on ‘power levels are bullshit’ but the other Bellamy only has a bounty of 38 mil which isn’t that much higher than Luffy’s perceived 30 mil. Seriously if Bellamy 2 isn’t serious somebody that close could easily kick his ass
                                                                                                * 22.3% of the way through the series the main antagonist appears, which is actually a pretty good amount in my experience, in fantasy you want to build up the world a little bit and get to know the characters and all that good shit.
                                                                                                * It’s been said a million times but that doesn’t make it less true, Blackbeard and Luffy are perfectly introduced as foils to one another which is why Blackbeard is considered to be the main villain despite not terrorizing Luffy as much as other antagonists throughout the series
                                                                                                * I’m sure this wasn’t what he was thinking at all but Blackbeard’s response to Luffy’s bounty could be interpreted as him expecting it to be higher
                                                                                                * Chapter 224
                                                                                                * Pointedly, everyone in the bar, not just Bellamy and friends, laughs at the idea of Sky-island
                                                                                                * Also, we know the city of gold and the One Piece exist so logically the city of emerald must exist somewhere in the world
                                                                                                * Chapter 225

                                                                                                * Blackbeard’s big speech happens
                                                                                                * I’ve seen people reference Zoro’s “not ‘him’, ‘they’” comment as a way of saying Blackbeard had multiple souls in his body and that’s why he can have multiple DF’s but I’m pretty sure he’s just saying Blackbeard has a crew with him
                                                                                                * Also, Blackbeard makes the point that some fights aren’t worth having which is interesting because it parallels how his crew was non-introduced. The Bellamys are all flashy and showing off their numbers when they show up but that’s really a sign of weakness because the Yonko level fighters are also on the island and hiding their power levels because it isn’t worth their time
                                                                                                * Also, Blackbeard doesn’t have much of a black beard which I’m sure is intentional misdirection by Oda
                                                                                                * Set-up for Water 7. Interesting that Sanji isn’t attached to the Merry the same way Usopp is, and to him Syrup Village is just a story he’s tired of hearing
                                                                                                * Chapter 226
                                                                                                * 4/25/22 Volume 25
                                                                                                * Chapter 227
                                                                                                * Set up for Luffy eventually betraying Merry
                                                                                                * First mention of Sanji being from the North Blue. Was this set up for Germa or was it just a throw-away line? First of all, The North and East are separated by the Red Line so it would be extremely difficult to cross. Second, the book could have been printed anywhere and that specific copy was from the North so there’d be in universe reasons not to bring anything up.
                                                                                                * Luffy refers to Cricket’s pressure sickness the same way he referred to Reverse Mountain and Dance Powder
                                                                                                * Chapter 228
                                                                                                * I’m surprised Nami can read notes from 400 years ago. Try reading unedited Shakespeare sometime to see what that’s like. It's English right? Should be easy
                                                                                                * Chapter 229
                                                                                                * Luffy refers to the clouds the way he referred to Dance Powder and Cricket’s sickness
                                                                                                * Usopp the Liar accuses a man who has unfairly been called a liar all his life of lying. It is of course untrue
                                                                                                * So, the Bellamy pirates are definitely flying Doffy’s flag in addition to their own. Theirs is lips on cross-bones. Weird how Doffy’s jolly roger is used as their figurehead
                                                                                                * Chapter 230
                                                                                                * It’s amazing that Usopp of all people isn’t afraid of spiders and bugs
                                                                                                * Is that a mother fuckin JoJo reference? (No bullshit this bird is using the exact spelling of JoJo in Japanese)                                              
                                                                                                   * Chapter 231
                                                                                                   * Is the reason Bellamy survived is because he was the only one that could absorb fall damage?
                                                                                                   * The first thing Nami did when she came back was check on other people’s treasure
                                                                                                   * Nami identifies Doffy’s mark as ‘Bellamy’s mark’
                                                                                                   * Chapter 232
                                                                                                   * How come nobody uses this panel?                                              
                                                                                                   * Bellamy’s powers foil Luffy’s, where Luffy stretches in straight lines Bellamy twists and compresses himself, this parallels how Luffy pursues his goals while Bellamy is content to stay in the same place picking on the same people
                                                                                                   * The best part about the punch is that Luffy isn’t even using his powers
                                                                                                      * Chapter 233
                                                                                                      * Random cut to Buggy in the middle of the chapter
                                                                                                      * Ace has a meeting with Buggy and friends. Subtly, Buggy reminisces on his time as a Roger pirate fighting Whitebeard. I wonder if Buggy ever cared that he met his former captain’s son
                                                                                                      * Marineford is set up a little
                                                                                                      * Gorosei are introduced and those ‘three great powers’ are mentioned again. Hopefully we’ll actually see what the third one is this time
                                                                                                      * The Gorosei had no words about Luffy’s DF this chapter
                                                                                                      * Chapter 234
                                                                                                      * Considering Doffy is already puppeteering people I’m betting that Jolly Roger is already written to be his.
                                                                                                      * Sengoku makes his first appearance along with his goat
                                                                                                      * Shank’s jobbers start at 94 mil
                                                                                                      * Marco and Whitebeard make their first appearances
                                                                                                      * I think this is only the second time the Blackbeard pirates are mentioned by name, that’d be too hard to verify though
                                                                                                      * A nation named Vira has been mentioned a few times and someone asked a question about it in the SBS. Oda’s response was that the person should be wondering if the world is changing. Bet its important
                                                                                                      * SBS: Sanji is very hairy

                                                                                                      * I appreciate that Blackbeard plans around the fact that the Strawhats are going to a Skyland
                                                                                                      * Chapter 236

Did they not know what he was doing?
                                                                                                      * I don’t know why the bird’s afraid, his job is done, he can just fly back to Jaya. Maybe he can’t because he is now south so he can’t turn north and head home
                                                                                                      * 4/26/22 Volume 26

                                                                                                      * Chapter 239

                                                                                                      * It’s also interesting that simply getting to the sky is not enough to get to Skypiea, you then have to journey a bit and then a lobster takes you the rest of the way
                                                                                                      * Nami says that they salvaged a Waver but I didn’t see one in the junk pile
                                                                                                      * No SBS this volume it’s all about name translations
                                                                                                      * Btw this is about 5 years for One Piece
                                                                                                      * Chapter 240

                                                                                                      * If the pseudoscience is to be believed the sea clouds are actually the island clouds but with Seastone molecules infused
                                                                                                      * Also, I think the ground clouds also have Seastone but Luffy and friends can touch them just fine so who knows?

                                                                                                      * Whatever the fuck Vearth is. Oda did that thing where he used a normal word but gave it special furigana, but the pronunciation makes no fucking sense. And no, ‘Vearth’ isn’t even close
                                                                                                      * Chapter 242

                                                                                                      * Chapter 245

That or the concepts weren’t completely developed yet
                                                                                                         * 4/27/22 Volume 27

                                                                                                         * I was excited for a second because there was a bird called a Roc but turns out that that was Viz vizing it up. A more literal translation would be ‘really long bird’
                                                                                                         * I think this battle might be the point where Chopper goes from mid-tier fighter to low-tier support
                                                                                                         * They keep doubling down on the fact that mantra is future sight. I’m really going to be on the look-out because I don’t remember anyone in story actually saying Haki = mantra
                                                                                                         * Chapter 249

                                                                                                         * Chapter 252

This is a regular thing for Nami but almost no one else cared about wealth at all. They only just noticed they were collectively broke a few chapters ago
                                                                                                         * Chapter 253

                                                                                                         * The One Piece is in the left eye of Jaya. Because when you start something, you fill in the right eye of the Daruma and the left eye when you finish it. So, when the story is complete the right eye of Jaya will be filled in. Both Jaya and Daruma have two A’s in them, this must be intentional
                                                                                                         * Oh, wow it’s that panel. I thought that was at the end of this arc. I guess this is kind of the end of an arc, they reunited the crew and defeated a powerful foe and all. It still kind of feels out of place. Also, the other partiers are wolves so what’s the symbolism there? I'm really having trouble finding the meaning in this panel which I wouldn’t have bothered with otherwise if it wasn’t pointed out to me. Zoro isn’t actually in the circle he’s off to the side with Gan Fall’s bird
                                                                                                         * Chapter 254

                                                                                                         * Enel has a ton of stuff written on the back of his couch and the Kanji is too stylized for me to translate
                                                                                                         * Chapter 255

                                                                                                         * I like how the horse bird comedy-attacks Sanji and Usopp and is then confused when his master agrees with them.
                                                                                                         * It’s kind of an odd question of who owns the sky-half of Jaya because the Shandians, in a way, invaded Skypiea, like if your car somehow fell into someone else’s garage and you can’t take it out of their garage would the homeowner be entitled to do what he wants with the car considering it’s taking up space in his garage?
                                                                                                         * “When a Person cannot act without a feeling of guilt, he is at his weakest.”
                                                                                                         * 4/28/22 Volume 28

                                                                                                         * That vassal jobbed really hard just then
                                                                                                         * Chapter 257
                                                                                                         * Something has been bothering me ever since I first read Skypiea and that’s the size of the White Sea. Is it just that one cloud that only hangs out around Jaya or are there several clouds like that throughout the land? It’s implied that this Skyland only exists because of the Knock Up Stream ejecting Seastone particles into it but surely there are other knock-up streams in the world? Are there just uninhabited Skylands all over the world? We learn later from Enel’s moon journey that Skypieans and Shandians share an origin yet somehow, they are all found in the same place.
                                                                                                         * I see the parallels to observation Haki but this explanation of Mantra seems more like the Voice of all Things. If you were reading One Piece for the first time the closest thing to Mantra so far would be when Zoro cut steel. Voice of all Things would actually make sense as something inherent to sky-people since they can’t read the writing in Shandora but Roger could understand through the VoaT
                                                                                                         * Chapter 258

                                                                                                         * Chapter 259
                                                                                                         * I think Viz got a hair in their scan
                                                                                                         * Menorah-hair can rotate his head like an owl
                                                                                                         * Chapter 260

                                                                                                         * Chapter 261

                                                                                                         * First mention of the Void Century. There was an allusion to a ‘real history’ in Alabasta but there wasn’t any mention of 100 years of history missing
                                                                                                         * Chapter 262

It does cover other arcs in a timely manner but not Wapol’s for some reason. Which is weird because Wapometal appears in the story before Wapol’s return but it would have no explanation
                                                                                                         * I have never understood why Tanuki is translated as racoon. Tanukis are real animals that exist in the real world, it would be like translating whatever the African word for a zebra is as horse

                                                                                                         * Chapter 264

                                                                                                         * The Shandian survives 1 million volts. For those who don’t know a mere 300 volts will kill a man, ignite his corpse, and char the ground around him

The Milky Road is and inlet for the entire structure of the island which is one big cloud, electricity dissipates the more particles it has to cross by reaching the Milky Road it had effectively infinite particles meaning there would be an average voltage of effectively zero on the road

It is also stated to be ‘the most powerful Logia’. Actually, upon further inspection that’s meant to mean Logias are the most powerful DFs. Good work Viz

                                                                                                         * Chapter 269

Robin finds a wall carving in the script but basically says it isn’t a Poneglyph which is weird because I’m pretty sure the ‘real’ Poneglyph of this island is also in a wall
                                                                                                         * Robin clearly has a much deeper knowledge of Shandora than she shares

                                                                                                         * Robin already knew what a Logia was

                                                                                                         * Enel says it is unnatural for the Sky-people to live in the sky

Also, despite there only being one Skylander with a DF the Shandians seem to know more about them than the Strawhats
                                                                                                         * Enel seems genuinely confused about them not wanting to go. I wonder if Enel knows the moon is a barren wasteland or if he’s just that sick of fluffy clouds
                                                                                                         * There’s a page about manga supplies

                                                                                                         * Ok, so as soon as it was introduced, people claimed Zoro had advanced armament the whole time. He just tried to slash Enel and failed, if he had advanced armament, he would have torn Enel in half. Imagine if that was the case and neither of them understood why it worked
                                                                                                         * Enel compares having dreams destroyed to dying. I only mention this because in a super early SBS Oda explained that destroying people’s ambitions is basically killing them
                                                                                                         * It sure is weird to me that Skypieans and Shandians are so similar yet so different. One lived on the earth, one lived in the clouds but, if you ignore the z-axis, they live in essentially the same spot on the globe. They both have natural but useless wings but different culture and architecture.
                                                                                                         * Interesting how his Devil Fruit restarts his heart, I can think of another character who performed a similar feat. Perhaps this is foreshadowing
                                                                                                         * Enel makes up some bullshit about how he is the embodiment of fear when he clearly was scared to die a few seconds ago
                                                                                                         * 4/30/22 Volume 30

                                                                                                         * Enel said he wanted strong people to support his kingdom hence the survival game but shouldn’t he know Nami was one of the weakest people involved
                                                                                                         * SBS: Pandaman was written on a Poneglyph

Think about it, ace is only ‘flames’ but lots of things besides oxygen can be flames when in their gaseous state, so Ace’s fruit is practically a ‘hot gas’ fruit
                                                                                                         * This scene of Luffy inside an eye is strangely familiar. Also, can’t help but notice Luffy is affecting both eyes at once somehow. That kid is also there so I doubt this is a DF thing
                                                                                                         * Chapter 278

                                                                                                         * One of the few times Viz translates ‘God’ it’s when Conis is denouncing him as one

Considering the idea of planes is unheard of I figure sky travel is mostly impossible. So how would the Beret even know of the existence of anything outside his cloud
                                                                                                         * Despite Viz’s sensitivity about calling Enel God they’ve actually added a Bible reference here by talking about right now as ‘the last supper’. Interestingly, and this is consistent across translations, Enel refers to Skylanders as ‘angels’
                                                                                                         * So, for any idiots out there who were wondering why people didn’t like the fact that Luffy had a Mythical Zoan the answer is this chapter right here. Up until this arc the only sub-categories of DFs were Zoans and everything else. This arc added both Logias and Paramecia and the first thing they said about Logias is that they are the strongest type. When Enel sees Luffy’s powers the first words out of his mouth are degrading, saying that Luffy has a lesser fruit because of its category. Luffy from there proves him wrong, not only is his fruit not weaker than Enel's, it's objectively better. Luffy then beats him, shattering Enel’s self-image as an ascendant being and sends him running to the moon.
                                                                                                         * The anime really didn’t do Enel’s face justice
                                                                                                         * Also, hate to put a damper on the moment, but just because something is an insulator doesn’t mean electricity will never go through it, that just means it takes significantly more electricity to go through. In other words, if you charged some rubber with, say, 100 million volts, it would still get shocked.
                                                                                                         * Chapter 280
                                                                                                         * Holy shit, Enel’s in the Yamcha pose
                                                                                                         * How did Enel figure out Luffy is weak to slash? It’s not like he smacked Luffy around a lot and Luffy constantly no-selled
                                                                                                         * Neat that he used the gold to travel
                                                                                                         * Enel appears to believe that Luffy is pirate royalty
                                                                                                         * SBS: Oda lists out the DFs in the series so far and which category they are in. The question asked was about what Enel meant by ‘retaining shape’ and why Crocodile didn’t follow that rule. Oda tries to say that Logias are exempt but then lists several Paramecia that change the person’s body. The original ‘body rule’ is truly dead
                                                                                                         * Chapter 281

                                                                                                         * Chapter 282

                                                                                                         * The full introduction of Devil Fruit types has made me look into things a little more. The DF types, like Poneglyphs, have actual kanji names with real translations but with special furigana. Zoan means animals and Logia means nature. Paramecia means super-human.
                                                                                                         * Chapter 283

People are dying, the tension’s mounting, and all Wyper can think about is the story of Noland who really had no relevance to what’s going on. I know it’s set up for the bell but Oda already did that a few times by giving it an interesting name and showing both the heroes and villains wanting to go after it.
                                                                                                         * Chapter 287

I can’t figure out what ‘kaien’ means and no other translation or even the anime has this. In Japanese the word can mean an opening as in a beginning or it can mean deep ocean and sea salt.
                                                                                                         * Oh, here it is. The only other mention of sun god anywhere in the story. Never mind that we know from like 10 pages from now that they’re referring to the big snake, clearly Nika was always the plan
                                                                                                         * The Joyboy heartbeat sfx is played on the drums here Dondottonto

                                                                                                         * Chapter 288

                                                                                                         * Noland’s a liar, Usopp’s a liar. Noland’s a botanist, Usopp’s a botanist
                                                                                                         * Chapter 289

                                                                                                         * It’s nice to, for once, not see ‘the noble savages’ trope
                                                                                                         * That’s a nice strawman you got there Noland. These people who have no understanding of disease and medicine are killing people because it makes them feel better. How ridiculous, they don’t know what to do and if by killing one person you save hundreds then the only logical decision is to kill the one person. And Kalgara is offended by the idea that they enjoy it because they don’t enjoy it. The concept of sacrifice on an altar is really no different than sending soldiers to war, it’s grim but it has to be done to protect more people.
                                                                                                         * They keep talking about how that priest that died, “could hear the voices of the gods”. I wonder if maybe he was hearing something else
                                                                                                         * ‘you people are awful. You should have specked into medicine 60 years ago to not be so awful’

                                                                                                         * Also, the prophet was right, none of this would have happened if they hadn’t attempted the sacrifice
                                                                                                            * Chapter 290

                                                                                                            * Viz says Noland’s plotting a course for Mary Geoise but other translations don’t say that, other translations say he’s going to his homeland with the weird spelling. But that doesn’t seem like the kind of mistake Viz would make since they’ve already named the homeland several times

The guy slices sea monsters like nothing surely, he’d just have to rock the boat a little and all those useless soldiers would have just vomited their guts out or something. Seriously, Oda has shown Noland to be extremely competent and everyone he was with on the return to Jaya to be extremely incompetent.
                                                                                                            * So, in One Piece executions are done primarily by decapitation with a pair of executioners. Do they need special training to time their strikes so that the cuts are uniform or do they take turns getting to execute the prisoner?

The story already covers the key points from the flashback and the flashback is poorly timed. Nothing would have really been lost if the flashback was moved away from the climax here.

                                                                                                            * Good thing the snake suddenly woke up and hit that beanstalk at the exact moment the person who was supposed to hit it was suddenly electrocuted by God Himself
                                                                                                            * Luffy at the top could cause the beanstalk to topple. The further from the center of mass and whatever
                                                                                                            * Robin uses the word romantic to describe the ringing of the bell

                                                                                                               * In another case of ‘both of these translations fucking suck’ Viz has Luffy ask what kind of God can’t protect his people and fanscan says ‘a shitty god is better off gone’. I don’t think either of these translations are entirely accurate
                                                                                                               * Enel’s form looks like a wisdom king which Luffy eventually also looks like
                                                                                                               * Ok, Luffy’s hand is sticking out one side of the ball and that hits Enel square in the face. The rest of Enel’s body is in full lightning form, shouldn’t he just phase right into the ball since it’s conductive?
                                                                                                               * Chapter 299

                                                                                                               * It didn’t even occur to me until just now with the bell ringing but Oda gave the fucking snake a tragic backstory about the loss of family, finding a new family, and then losing that family too. Yet the will of the dead is inherited by the next generation. This megafauna is the embodiment of One Piece
                                                                                                               * SBS: A fan makes fun of Oda’s dad jokes and Oda says he’s still in his twenties

                                                                                                               * Turns out there was a silhouette panel at the end of this arc but the one on 253 actually looks more like the final version. For comparison’s sake                                     253:   300:  1044:                                                              But the full moon was shown in this chapter but not 253
                                                                                                               * Hey look Sanji is already foreshadowing his time skip training                                
                                                                                                               *                                                                                                                  * So that’s another hundred, this was certainly a far better chapter than 200; however overall, I’d say the period of 100-200 was better than 200-300. There was only the wrap-up to Alabasta, Jaya and Skypiea. Jaya is a really excellent section, I think it’s actually a bit underrated because it’s so short, but it covers a lot of subjects very well and very quickly. And while the existence of Skypiea really expands the world with the idea that there is a whole other sea to be explored, Skypiea itself is really boring. It just looks like a beach. Sure, their society is fucked up and tyrannical but that feels like its only like that to get the plot moving towards Enel. Compare it to Dressrosa where the horribleness of the setting is explored thoroughly to the point where some members of the crew are helpless victims of it. Meanwhile in Skypiea the abducted crew members just leave to go looking around. Enel was a great villain, he was very intimidating, his omnipresence and absurd power level really made it feel like he deserved the title of God. Also in 200-300 were the introduction of the Paramecia and Logia types and honestly, I think they were a mistake. Already there are several fruits that break the rules. Luffy is made of natural rubber so by the definition of ‘things found in nature’ he should be a Logia. Bon Clay can change his whole body so by the definition of ‘control over their bodies’ he should be a Logia. Mr. 1 is basically metal which is just as natural as sand or lightning but because he can’t make holes for bullets to go through, I guess it doesn’t count. The story is still moving at a good pace though it has, again, been about two years for 100 chapters, but the number of things done is starting to slow down.

                                                                                                                  * Hey look another silhouette                                                          
                                                                                                                  * Hey look, the entire crew was Nika. Hell, maybe Nika is the concept of Nakama  
                                                                                                                  * Does Usopp ever use dials after the time skip?
                                                                                                                  * Why do the Shandians know about the Poseidon?
                                                                                                                  * Robin doesn’t touch this Poneglyph. Much like her I feel no interest in this one, especially since this is the only ancient weapon, we’ve learned anything about
                                                                                                                  * Roger’s message is rather unclear even now. One translation says that Roger followed its guidance which would lead them to Fishman Island. I think that is the most accurate given the rest of the story but the other two translations I have say that Roger will ‘guide this text’ and who even knows what that means. It’s not saying he will guide Poseidon; he’d be guiding the text. Robin comes to the conclusion that he means to put all the Poneglyphs together to tell the real history but that’s very obviously not what’s written. It’s not like Roger needs to speak vaguely so his enemies don’t find out his intent, the message is already encoded. He could just say “I’m going to combine these texts”
                                                                                                                  * We’ve seen already that things in Shandora are only gold-plated yet the Shandians feel the need to carry the entire column instead of simply ripping the plating off. And don’t give me any, ‘Enel melted it’ they have fire dials
                                                                                                                  * Gan Fall notices the D. but doesn’t appear to have any greater knowledge, he just comments that Roger also has a D.
                                                                                                                  * There was no mention of how Roger read the Poneglyphs which is weird because I distinctly remember them saying it was the Voice of all Things
                                                                                                                     * Chapter 302
                                                                                                                     * Chapter 303
                                                                                                                     * Doffy with the flag confirmation
                                                                                                                     * Translations suck ass again. What Doffy was mad about was that he wanted the Bellamy Pirates to sow random chaos by pitting people against one another but they decided to act on their own opinions that Skylands were a delusion and that’s why they lost. Amazingly this is very in line with Doffy’s later character and the speech he gives at the end sounds really similar to his prison speech  
                                                                                                                     * It really, really looks like Bellamy was just brutally murdered in the street
                                                                                                                     * Usopp insults his crewmate AGAIN, by saying Zoro won’t go to heaven. Zoro’s a Buddhist so he doesn’t believe in that stuff but seriously
                                                                                                                     * Aokiji is called the strongest in the Marines which we know to be untrue
                                                                                                                     * Aokiji complains about the entire Monkey family, I wonder what his conniptions about Garp are
                                                                                                                        * Chapter 304

There haven’t been any civilian ships in the series so far, it’s just pirates or marines. If there are no merchant ships, where the fuck are all these pirates pirating?
                                                                                                                        * Chopper is still talking to animals

You see this beautiful reunion between friends who haven’t seen each other in a decade, they’re smiling and laughing then one is just shot from across the field.
                                                                                                                        * Smart to use a low bounty to make Foxy not look like a threat

                                                                                                                        * This entire setup is very un-nakama. I only even mention this because this is a ‘traditional pirate game’ and most pirates, even the villains, are very nakama.
                                                                                                                        * Two arcs ago the point was about not fighting pointless battles, now it’s an unwritten rule that you must fight every time you're challenged? What makes it worse is that Luffy is the person who taught that lesson and now he’s the person picking a meaningless fight.
                                                                                                                        * Seriously? How are there not dozens of pirates who lose and then go ‘fuck it’? Remember Bellamy? Remember when he lost in Poker and he killed the other guy?
                                                                                                                        * Davy Jones was cursed by a demon and lives on the seafloor. I wonder if that is somehow referring to him being a DF user and died by drowning
                                                                                                                        * This chapter was way wordier than a normal chapter
                                                                                                                        * Chapter 307
                                                                                                                        * The anime makes this scene even more stupid and frustrating by making the Strawhats stupider and having Foxy cheat more
                                                                                                                        * Boy, if only Robin could just sprout limbs from somewhere and tear the opponents ship apart
                                                                                                                        * The Foxes researched Zoro and Luffy but not Robin?
                                                                                                                        * Boy, if only Nami could use weather magic to create a storm cloud that sinks their enemy
                                                                                                                        * The Strawhats hear Foxy called the ‘King of Interference’ and don’t immediately move to stop him
                                                                                                                        * Chapter 308
                                                                                                                        * Why isn’t Robin instantly growing legs on Foxy’s stomach and kicking him in the dick. The announcer is literally yelling through a megaphone that Foxy’s going to try and fuck them over.
                                                                                                                        * Remember at Whisky Peak when they tried to distract the Strawhats with food and alcohol but Zoro was just pretending to play along? He has no good reason to be playing along right now, he knows these guys are his enemies.
                                                                                                                        * Ok, if Foxy’s antics up to this point were like the sign, I could see how they’d underestimate him. However, that smokescreen was legitimately meant to stop them and the reason they made it out was because of Nami’s skills. That’s the sort of thing that would make people more wary, ‘that would have killed a normal man’ sort of thinking. Which again leads to the question of why aren’t they subduing him?
                                                                                                                        * Foxy has hit them with the Slow-beam, why hasn’t the rest of the crew immediately attacked Foxy and the other ship? Seriously, Sanji would attack Foxy for attacking Nami and Robin, and Zoro would kill that shark pulling the other ship, and then it wouldn’t matter how slow they’re going. The paneling is pretty deceptive but the crowd is standing right next to Foxy when he fires the beam and the other ship is way behind.
                                                                                                                        * Chapter 309
                                                                                                                        * It’s not that they lost, it’s that the characters had so many chances to act like they normally would that would fix the situation and they didn’t.
                                                                                                                        * Also really doesn’t reduce the salt any that the only application of Foxy’s power is to fuck people over in races
                                                                                                                        * They are specifically photons so how does Foxy have any control over their direction?
                                                                                                                        * Why do they want Chopper? Like the only worse pick would be Usopp and the Foxes already have a doctor
                                                                                                                        * They got a Fishman-Giant, that’s like the omni-creature
                                                                                                                        * Chapter 310
                                                                                                                        * I mentioned at some point that there was a cover page dragon that looked exactly like Momonosuke, well here’s another dragon that looks neither like Momonosuke nor Kaido in case you thought Oda could only draw dragons one way
                                                                                                                        * Why does Zoro give up his swords? Why are the Strawhats letting the Foxes set all the rules?
                                                                                                                        * Chapter 311
                                                                                                                        * I really don’t know why the Strawhats are acknowledging the rulings of the Foxes. If they didn’t play along the Foxes would either stop trying, try to guilt-trip them, or use force. If they stop trying, good. If they try to guilt-trip the Strawhats, they can just ignore it. If the Foxes try to use force there’s a good chance the Strawhats would win. The Strawhats are a powerful bunch and Foxy himself is very weak. His crew would probably drop their loyalty entirely if it came to violence since the only reason they're even on his crew is because somebody else lost a gambling match. The level of enthusiasm among the Foxes is actually really unrealistic. Yu Yu Hakusho had a really similar, and overall better arc with the Dark Tournament arc. The difference between this arc and that is that the crew in Yu Yu was literally in an entire world of demons so they couldn’t question the rulings. If they did and it turned to violence, they’d have to fight an entire world of demons who wanted them dead anyway, not just a shoddy crew of thieves and traitors.
                                                                                                                        * Luffy is not participating this round, there is no reason he couldn’t attack the ref, none of the players broke any rules
                                                                                                                        * Why is the ref even bothering to pretend he can’t see? Oh, I get it, it’s supposed to be funny
                                                                                                                        * Chapter 312
                                                                                                                        * I hope I made it obvious that I don’t dislike comedy but this entire arc is making everything a gag and none of it lands at all. Right here Foxy orders a ‘Monster Burger’ and Oda draws everyone with funny faces but there literally isn’t a joke there it’s just a special move. Why are the Foxes terrified? This isn’t like when Kuro started flailing wildly, it’s just another special move that doesn’t even hit the audience. The other problem with making this entire arc a joke is that Foxy is the first villain to legitimately damage the Strawhats ever. After like, Kuro at the latest, the reader is aware that people don’t die in One Piece so nobody is in danger from violence. However, Foxy has not only made the Strawhats lose but has literally stolen a crewmate. This is literally the same reason Enes Lobby is top tier, because it’s a threat to the crew itself. But here Oda expects us to be laughing with Foxy as he slowly tears the crew apart by rigging all the games.
                                                                                                                        * It is good to see that overwhelming odds forces two bitter rivals to work together
                                                                                                                        * Chapter 313
                                                                                                                        * The fuck are they mad about? Peanut tactics? They did the same thing last round now they’re mad that the Strawhats did it better? I’m surprised they didn’t have Zoro or somebody go, “You know that means we’ll have to keep him on our crew, right?” and then Foxy has a little sulk. Never mind
                                                                                                                        * I truly don’t understand why Foxy is so beloved by his crew, surely the shit-eating grin alone would make some of them uncomfortable
                                                                                                                        * There’s a tattoo of a crossbones right where Luffy eventually has an x shaped scar
                                                                                                                        * Chapter 314

                                                                                                                        * Chapter 315

More importantly it shouldn’t be public knowledge that Robin is with the Strawhats. How did this random secretary find out about this information that, at best, only high-ranking Gov officials should know?

I don’t remember where but scientists were studying trees and they discovered that all the trees in about a mile radius were genetically identical. Turns out they were all the same tree connected by their roots
                                                                                                                           * Sure is perfect that Usopp managed to miss Luffy trying to defend the Merry before Luffy ultimately decides that he has to get a new ship. Sure would be unfortunate if Usopp saw Luffy as completely uncaring and heartless despite their previous conversations
                                                                                                                           * Chapter 329

                                                                                                                           * Franky is fully clothed, how unusual

                                                                                                                           * And he’s passed out and his nose is again broken.

                                                                                                                           * Usopp gets a walk. Chopper is in it. Does that mean Chopper > Usopp?

                                                                                                                           * I like that you can see the repairs on the Franky House from Usopp’s earlier intrusion

                                                                                                                           * Maybe Luffy shouldn’t be smiling as he’s telling Usopp they’re planning to euthanize Merry
                                                                                                                           * Also, Luffy apparently lacks the emotional maturity to remember how he reacted that morning and try to explain that the Merry is beyond repair

                                                                                                                           * Luffy points out that Usopp isn’t a carpenter, a point he himself has also made, Nami reacts like Luffy just called Usopp a retard.
                                                                                                                           * The flag Usopp designed flutters in the wind as Usopp lies and says he has no connection with the crew
                                                                                                                           * Usopp is the one who challenged Luffy to a fight
                                                                                                                           * Chapter 332
                                                                                                                           * Nami sounds like my mom
                                                                                                                           * He un-nakamaed Chopper. Truly Usopp is even more villainous than Foxy
                                                                                                                           * “I feel like our crew is falling apart” as much as I snark at this argument this is a really strong section of the entirety of the manga. One Piece is all about the nakama to a ridiculous extent and so having challenges that actually threaten the cohesiveness of the crew hit harder than fighting a bigger number every arc.
                                                                                                                           * I like that Usopp uses his old tired lies to trick Luffy into thinking he can’t trick him
                                                                                                                           * This seems pretty silly unless you know that the Merry is actually, literally alive  
                                                                                                                              * Chapter 333

                                                                                                                              * I’m surprised Franky is even able to go near the Sea Train without horrible PTSD episodes
                                                                                                                              * Chapter 335

                                                                                                                              * It really is weird reading this and knowing who the CP9 agents are because they are just drawn like they’re part of the carpentry crew
                                                                                                                              * Chapter 336

                                                                                                                              * 5/6/22 Volume 36

                                                                                                                              * In Water 7 they refer to lots of things as ‘Water-Water’ which is the nomenclature for Devil Fruits but there hasn’t been a water-water fruit
                                                                                                                              * Chapter 338

                                                                                                                              * Nami and Luffy seem to have a lot of one-on-one time at this point in the series. Right now, he just grabbed her and swung away like Tarzan. During Skypiea it was basically just the two of them vs Enel. I ain’t a shipwright but it seems like something was intended
                                                                                                                              * Chapter 339
                                                                                                                              * His name is obviously Bruno but everyone, even the wikis, spell it Blueno
                                                                                                                              * Kokoro asks Bruno about CP9 while pointing right at him. Now that’s foreshadowing
                                                                                                                              * Chapter 340
                                                                                                                              * It’s interesting because, other than Whisky Peak and 5 seconds of Drum Island, the islands visited haven’t really had any strong opinions towards pirates one way or the other. When we got to Water 7 the Strawhats were surprised that no one cared about them being pirates, which wasn’t that unusual. Clearly that was meant to create contrast with now, where they are being hunted down by everyone.
                                                                                                                              * I’m glad Robin decided to yell at them from across a canal with strong winds blowing. Her words may not have reached them but the symbolism of the gap between them should have delivered the message
                                                                                                                              * Chapter 341

                                                                                                                              * Chapter 342

                                                                                                                              * SBS: Crocs bounty is at least twice his original. That still isn’t much
                                                                                                                              * Chapter 343

                                                                                                                              * It’s a good thing Bruno’s a big guy, if he were Chopper sized nobody would be able to fit through his doors
                                                                                                                              * Chapter 344
                                                                                                                              * Hey look its Pell
                                                                                                                              * I’m surprised Robin doesn’t grow an arm out of Iceberg’s wrist and stick her finger in the pistol hole
                                                                                                                              * Since Alabasta each arc has had a smidgen of ancient weapon in them. It’s weird to have any amount of emphasis on them when the Last time they’re really brought up is on Fishman Island and then the big ancient items are the Road Poneglyphs
                                                                                                                              * I heard a theory once that the blueprints aren’t actually Pluton, they’re a weapon to fight Pluton. I don’t know how you could possibly interpret Iceberg’s statement here to be anything other than the real Pluton. What he means is that the blueprints themselves are the counter measure, like Star Wars.
                                                                                                                              * Chapter 345

                                                                                                                              * The Six Powers are almost never used after this arc. When I saw the fight with Who’s-Who I completely forgot what they were. It’s extra weird because Oda didn’t even try to retcon it into Haki despite sharing some techniques

Also, Kalifa said they should go and Lucci, the secret agent, decided to start styling on the Strawhats
                                                                                                                              * SBS: Question about non-canon fruits

                                                                                                                              * The line about carnivorous Zoans being more aggressive. How does Chopper know that? Is the human fruit considered a carnivorous Zoan? Did Chopper get the Model: Vegetarian?
                                                                                                                              * Lucci explains that Zoans are very good for hand-to-hand. This speech really feels like they’re trying to say that Lucci’s fruit has a higher power level than Enel’s
                                                                                                                              * Paulie tries the ‘I know you’re in their’ gambit. Lucci says no

Like as people were talking about it leading up to this moment, I had an image in my head and my image is this panel. Appropriate for the emotion of the moment I guess

Though it is never stated the general assumption is that Roger didn’t get the title of King until after Raftel, but the ship was built before Raftel. In other words, the government is retroactively punishing Tom for a crime. The extent of this nonsense is unclear, if somebody ever served Roger dinner would they be accused of supporting his crimes?
                                                                                                                                 * Death is also not an appropriate punishment, arms manufacturers in the real world don’t get the fucking death penalty. Murderers in the real world don’t get the death penalty most of the time. What is this Death Note?
                                                                                                                                 * Chapter 355

                                                                                                                                 * Spandam says that they found out Tom has the plans because they investigated the history of Water 7
                                                                                                                                 * The Gorosei looked exactly the same 8 years ago
                                                                                                                                 * I love that Iceberg reacts to the Pluton with horror while Franky reacts with excitement
                                                                                                                                 * How could you possibly blame Tom for this incident? Franky is 26, he is an adult man, he’d be tried for the misuse of these things. There is no way anyone would make a mistake about whose they are, they all have FRANKY written on them. You can’t try somebody for something their student did. The 9/11 hijackers were actually trained state-side and the government didn’t go after the pilots that taught them.

                                                                                                                                 * Iceberg’s full of shit. It doesn’t matter who made the weapon, only who fires it. That person who fired the weapon would just find another one.
                                                                                                                                 * Mr. Tom is in a bloody pile on the floor, what is the Justice going to show up and say, “Clearly he attacked us and then impaled himself to throw us off the scent.”
                                                                                                                                 * The citizens explain why this is bullshit between themselves without coming to the conclusion that what the government is telling them is bullshit. Now that’s what I call realistic
                                                                                                                                 * Chapter 357

I do wonder why Oda did this, these color pages were made at the time the chapter released and neither of these two are back on the crew for a while. And it’s not like this was a volume release thing either. I checked; this volume only came out about a month after its last chapter ran in Jump
                                                                                                                                 * How can these idiots think Tom built the battleships? They literally just had an argument about how Franky shouldn’t disown his ships
                                                                                                                                 * That was an excellent flashback. It got lots of stuff in and was only 4 chapters long
                                                                                                                                 * 5/8/22 Volume 38

                                                                                                                                 * Iceberg was introduced as childish and not wanting to do his mayoral duties but here Iceberg is shown to be determined to change the system
                                                                                                                                 * Franky tells Iceberg to burn the plans in front of a government agent

Again, I think this is a Death Star plans sort of thing
                                                                                                                                 * We see some custom Snail Phones here

                                                                                                                                 * Iceberg’s bullshit philosophy would never allow him to do anything. He conflates all innocent desires with inevitable damage and since one of his prime examples is simply learning about history, he really shouldn’t have any limit on what he thinks can cause harm.
                                                                                                                                 * Poor Robin, she doesn’t know that there are only 5 Strawhats now

You know I’m joking but that whole cutting steel lesson was actually about how his swords should only cut exactly what he wanted them to so it actually makes sense why no humans got cut since he just wanted to move the car.

Nero didn’t even really lose yet, Luffy takes worse beatings all the time and then gets back up.
                                                                                                                                                   * What really makes the government seem completely evil here is that they are essentially persecuting Robin for a thought crime. By merely knowing the history she is treated as if she will awaken the ancient weapons and ‘burn the world to ash’. Lucci even makes the distinction by saying she’s ‘an actual criminal’ and comparing that fact to the fact that she was originally an eight-year-old who knew too much.
                                                                                                                                                   * I honestly don’t understand what Lucci is trying to get at by saying Robin will be tortured. It’s not like he needs a psychological advantage in the fight. Is he just evil?
                                                                                                                                                   * Chapter 374

                                                                                                                                                   * Chapter 376

Since everything Sniper King says eventually turns out to be true this must mean Raftel is inside someone’s heart. The only person who’s heart we could reasonably enter is Capone’s so the One Piece must be there
                                                                                                                                                   * Luffy mentions he has a move he wants to try out
                                                                                                                                                   * Why does Paulie know about the inner areas of Enes Lobby if he was only there to work on the tracks?
                                                                                                                                                   * Zoro has a gag about how Nami and Sniper King are supposed to be with the Strawhats but shouldn’t Sniper King be with the Franky family since he’s just a tagalong?
                                                                                                                                                   * I saw a theory recently that Nika created Enes Lobby’s landscape. While I don’t believe it, Luffy’s reaction of ‘that hole’s awesome’ would tie into inherited will or whatever assuming Nika made Enes Lobby this way on purpose
                                                                                                                                                   * Don’t know why this thought came to my mind: Imagine if the Yonko bounties are just set with no expectation of paying out. Then somebody actually manages to turn one in and the WG doesn’t have enough money to pay out the bounty. They can’t not because if that person is powerful enough to collect that bounty, they are powerful enough to fuck up the WG. So, the WG has to print tons of money to pay out the bounty and then the world economy collapses
                                                                                                                                                   * Chapter 377
                                                                                                                                                   * Earlier today I was reading some threads and some people were bitching about how there’s random nobodies in Wano and that’s dragging the story down. You’d be hard pressed to find anyone who doesn’t consider Enes Lobby to be top tier. But right now, we are watching a fight of ‘random nobodies’ that being the Galley-La and the Franky House vs some idiot guards. Just going by chapter count these guys have been in the story way less than most people in the raid on Onigashima but I’ve never heard anybody complain that time is dedicated to them.
                                                                                                                                                   * One of the giants complains about how he doesn’t get enough sleep and that made me wonder how anyone could possibly sleep on Enes Lobby. Leaving light at a constant level for days on end is a real-life form of torture
                                                                                                                                                   * There was an advertisement for other volumes at the end of this chapter so I want to take this time to talk about releases. At the time of this chapter’s actual release, it was August 2005, at the time of this volume’s Japanese release it was November 2005. When viz released this volume in English it was April 2010. From about 2003 – 2009 Viz only released like 4 volumes a year of One Piece and only covered up to Alabasta. However, on January 5 2010 they released 4 volumes at once, and then another 5 in Feb 2010, and then 5 in March, 5 more in April, you get the point. Basically 30 volumes of One Piece were released in 2010 alone, they didn’t catch up, and the translations still suck. I thought this might have something to do with 4kids but likely not, the only connection that exists is that 4kids ended right before Jaya and the acceleration happened right before Jaya. My best guess is that Marineford was happening so somebody was like, ‘hey maybe we should get on this; turns out this story isn’t just about desserts and clouds’
                                                                                                                                                   * 5/10/22 Volume 40

                                                                                                                                                   * Power Levels are introduced for this arc and this arc alone. Not really sure why Oda decided to do this
                                                                                                                                                   * Franky’s chains aren’t tied to anything, they’d just slide off
                                                                                                                                                   * ‘Most wanted woman in the world’ Big Mom also exists. There have been some vague statements that could be interpreted as the Yonko but there hasn’t been any statement that there are 3 other Whitebeards running around out there.
                                                                                                                                                   * Spandam is deluded, this is obvious. Rob Lucci isn’t. Lucci never makes mention of the fact that he’s doing this for the greater good or whatever he's just kind of a masochist.
                                                                                                                                                   * Excellent fucking work Viz; in their translation they have Spandam saying ‘we must eliminate Fishmen’. What he actually said was ‘we have to eliminate people like that fishman’ so viz made him a racist by accident
                                                                                                                                                   * Chapter 380

Honestly, I thought they kept this charade up for the rest of this arc, I am actually surprised his mask fell off
                                                                                                                                                   * SBS: Oda states he’s actually doing the pages for Robin’s backstory right now
                                                                                                                                                   * Chapter 382

                                                                                                                                                   * Chopper can talk to the Bulls
                                                                                                                                                   * Bruno says there are ~170 allied countries in the WG; that’s slightly smaller than the UN’s 193. I wonder if that means the One Piece world is itself slightly smaller than our own. Also, there’s 170 countries but only 50 kings?
                                                                                                                                                   * I’d love to see a reanimation of Rock Lee vs. Gaara but with Gear 2nd Luffy vs. Bruno
                                                                                                                                                   * Chapter 384
                                                                                                                                                   * Here’s another hail Mary by Oda, the Little Garden Giants are suddenly relevant again 250ish chapters later
                                                                                                                                                   * It’s not like these rank-and-file marines know the content of Impel Down, why are the giants taking their anger out on them and not Spandam?
                                                                                                                                                   * Chapter 385
                                                                                                                                                   * Bon Clay actually looks like a normal person, that’s not right. And if he isn’t wearing makeup now, how did he get all that makeup in jail?
                                                                                                                                                   * So, this is probably the most important chapter regarding DFs in the entire series.
                                                                                                                                                   * First of all, CP-9 is talking with obvious authority that 2 DFs on one person have been tested and that kills them. People have suggested using Blackbeard as evidence that people can have 2 DFs; it's just government propaganda that they can’t. CP-9 I figure would have some insider knowledge above the propaganda so I’m going to say 2 DFs is still against the rules for the average person.
                                                                                                                                                   * Next the idea of ‘Devils in the fruits’. First time I read it I thought that when Bruno admonishes Jabra for ‘believing rumors’ he meant that the rumor was that there was a devil inside the fruit. However, when Bruno is explaining how things work, he specifically mentions that what scientists understand is the ‘transmission of powers’. This makes sense given the Zoan-weapons but also doesn’t contradict the idea that there are devils in the fruits. Spandam (an incredibly sound-minded and reliable man) also states ‘I don’t know what sort of devils are within these fruits’ implying their presence.
                                                                                                                                                   * Lucci also kind of implies that the ‘curse’ of the DFs would magnify the more you had. If that’s referring to the water weakness I wonder if Blackbeard can even drink without going into a coma
                                                                                                                                                   * This is one of Viz’s more famous fuck-up translations. The way it’s stated in Viz implies that simply by eating the fruit you learn its name but I have two other translations that imply the fruit is named after the powers. Also, the DF Encyclopedia is mentioned
                                                                                                                                                   * Kaku says he feels ‘a strange power, like gravity’ coming from the fruit. I wonder if DFs pick people, the Nika fruit might have chosen its user. Who knows? I thought of that because Kaku really likes his fruit so maybe they were meant to be or something. He also implies DFs are natural
                                                                                                                                                   * Kaku actually peels his DF. Makes sense it is a banana
                                                                                                                                                   * They sense no immediate change; I wonder how most DF users discover their power.

Most of it sounds like Jaguar but that H is definitely pronounced the way you expect. It’s like they were reading the word with the Spanish J like jalapeño. It must be intentional because there is a way to pronounce the J correctly in Japanese: ジャ. Here throw these in to google translate and see which sounds more like Jaguar                         ジャグワール or ハグワール

Saul specifically says he’s not from Elbaf, which means that line of D. is not from Elbaf. Now, granted, this doesn’t remove the possibility of there being another line of D. in Elbaf but why would these facts be mentioned together then? I don’t know, I’m sure we’ll get answers by chapter 1392

I know he had Oden to read the Poneglyphs but he stumbled onto them completely independently of these guys. He even started on the opposite side of the world

The Gorosei are completely silent with an ellipsis until Clover says ‘and its name was’. Think about that, the government was perfectly willing to let the people hear the history but the name alone earned an execution. It must be a name that people in-universe would recognize. Yet nobody theorizes about what the name might be. I think its Germany

Oda is wrong, he declares any pool of water to be ‘the sea’. That’s wrong, the chemical makeup of the sea is different from rivers and lakes. This also throws a wrench into the mechanics of Seastone since just one touch is enough to drain all energy. Unless, like right now with Robin, you need them to walk around and emote in which case it just turns their powers off. Also, this answer came from a question about Crocodile’s bathing habits. Oda says Croc would shower but if he showers his sand could get washed down the drain so I think he uses a wooden tub that you have to empty by tipping it

                                                                                                                                                            * Being a ship technician myself, I know there’s no way you could tell if a blueprint would produce a functional ship just by flipping through it. But hey, good use of the characters you have there to prove that Franky’s telling the truth
                                                                                                                                                            * I’m going to do my hundred-chapter recap now because I don’t want to do it right at the start tomorrow. First of all, release is slowing down a little. Not much though, these hundred were over 2.25 years as opposed to the previous 2. 300-400 was the best section yet, Water 7 and Enes Lobby deserve the hype but if you’re looking for unbridled praise look somewhere else. 300-400 actually managed to cover more ground than 200-300 going to Long Ring Long Land, Water 7 and Enes Lobby (and Ohara if you wanna cheat). However, the villains kind of suck in this section. CP-9 is a bunch of goofy weirdos with their leader being the most serious, stick-up-his-ass edgelord I’ve ever seen. I’m not really against goofy weirdos or edgelords but I think that edgelords are a bit inappropriate for One Piece and I think goofy weirdos are a bit inappropriate for the CIA. I think Kaku should have been the leader of CP-9. He’s a little goofy but takes himself seriously enough so that he seems like an assassin with that politeness that makes it seem like the marines are supposed to be the good guys. Foxy on the other hand was something else. I had been reading for a while now what I thought to be shitposts; people actually praising Foxy and the Davy Back Fight. They were kind of right. Like I said earlier, the Foxy pirates were the first legitimate threat the Strawhats faced. But again, with Foxy it really seems like the reader is supposed to be laughing with him but it’s kind of hard to laugh when you see everyone you care about being ripped apart. In terms of overarching story however there were major reveals right at the end with the functionality of DFs and the Ancient Kingdom. After reading those DF pages again I was actually really excited to get to Robin’s flashback to see how much I missed but it really felt like squeezing blood from a stone.

Lassoo, the gun-dog, was said to have been made by Vegapunk. How did Mr. 4 get ahold of him? I initially filled it in as ‘he works for Croc and Croc works for the WG’ but he didn’t actually know Croc until the day before Lassoo appears. I’m pretty sure Mr. 4 was also carrying Lassoo in gun mode long before they met Croc.
                                                                                                                                                            * Why does Chopper revert to his hybrid form? Shouldn’t he be a deer?
                                                                                                                                                            * Proof that Sniper King isn’t Usopp: he couldn’t tell when Jabra was lying
                                                                                                                                                            * Chapter 414
                                                                                                                                                            * I read 1049 earlier today and if I weren’t reading this arc right now, I would have been confused by the CP-0 guy running on air to get away from Onigashima. I had completely forgotten all their powers until this reread and I was trying to remember if these powers are even brought up again after this arc
                                                                                                                                                            * Chapter 415
                                                                                                                                                            * Jabra says, ‘his foot turned red’ because the manga is in black and white and there’s no way for the reader to know what color it is. The line was kept in the anime. Also, this may or may not be possible due to Sanji’s father, it’s explained as friction from spinning really fast.
                                                                                                                                                            * SBS: Enel’s bounty would be over 500 mil.
                                                                                                                                                            * Chapter 416
                                                                                                                                                            * Does the bandana give him strength or something? Or does he just wait until he’s ready to finish to put it on? I swear Zoro has never won a fight without the bandana. Kaku sharing my thoughts. I wrote this on the page before Kaku talked
                                                                                                                                                            * Zoro was trying to use the steel-cutting technique but it didn’t work because Kaku wasn’t using the iron-body technique. First of all, it didn’t work because Zoro was on the wrong frequency, he was on the iron frequency when he should have been on the flesh frequency. Second, I guess the iron-body technique literally turns your body to iron. Third, Kaku knew how to recognize the technique and how to respond.
                                                                                                                                                            * Chapter 417

                                                                                                                                                            * SBS: Oda apparently decides which chapters to put in the novels himself. Also, he sometimes puts more chapters in than the average manga. In Enies Lobby a lot of volumes have 10 chapters as opposed to the normal nine. If you take the number of chapters and put them into volumes of exactly nine chapters there would actually be 116 volumes of One Piece right now

                                                                                                                                                            * Rob mentions that he’d “like to tell a certain idiot about [Luffy]” other translations make it sound like he means that he’d like to talk about Luffy’s leadership meaning that idiot is Spandam, but hey, maybe it means something else.
                                                                                                                                                            * I know it works on cartoon logic but seeing gear third, the bones aren’t connected so air can’t pass between them, even if they could it’s not like you’ve added a ton of mass to the punch so it wouldn’t be that much stronger, if you could add mass to it you’d still have to punch harder to make it move and if you could punch harder why did you inflate the fist, assuming everything else made sense if the hand was bigger than the target you’d be dissipating a lot of force into the air

Interestingly Funny Valentine of Steel Ball Run was introduced one year prior to this chapter but his back scars were not revealed until two years after this chapter
                                                                                                                                                            * Chapter 423

Obviously, this refers to Dragon, I guess I didn’t notice that he wasn’t yet stated to be Luffy’s father

Granted there are still whacky techniques in this fight but they only exist to increase power levels. There’s not bouncing punches off a wall or making a net out of fingers, it’s just move faster and punch harder.

That means he thought Sniper King was somebody else the entire time

                                                                                                                                                                  * Luffy always seems to sleep for way too long after he over uses his powers. I would be extremely disappointed if that’s what Oda meant by chipping away at his lifespan.
                                                                                                                                                                  * Galley-La’s logo is a gondola, but nobody uses gondolas in Water 7 they use Bulls
                                                                                                                                                                  * Viz mistranslated ‘continue to stand’ as ‘cannot be cut down’ in regards to the Adam Tree. This is only a problem because of the immediate question of where did they get the wood. The tree can’t be indestructible because Franky got wood from it
                                                                                                                                                                  * Also, people say that this must be the One Piece equivalent of Yggdrasil but I doubt that because most people place it on Elbaf but Franky has no reason not to mention Elbaf and in fact reason to mention Elbaf considering those giants that came back with them are from Elbaf. He could just say, “on the island of Elbaf, you know where those two SUPERRRR giant warriors are from, there is a certain tree.” Also, he specifically cites cannon usage which giants don’t use and that the civilization has been razed and rebuilt several times but giants live a long time
                                                                                                                                                                  * Chapter 432

He doesn’t mention Sabo but I’m pretty sure he never knew about Sabo so that actually fits the retcon well
                                                                                                                                                                  * Garp and Luffy randomly fall asleep, like Ace
                                                                                                                                                                  *                                                                                                                                                                     * First mention of the Yonko
                                                                                                                                                                  * Wow these guys, so while they were all on the Rocketman heading to Enes Lobby some other Galley-La man asked Paulie who the CP-9 assassins were and they said they probably already knew. Paulie said it was who it was and they were shocked because they thought it was two random characters that were never introduced. Somebody asked in the SBS who these characters were and Oda drew them and gave them a backstory and now here they are  
                                                                                                                                                                  * Koby it’s only been 6 months at most why do you look ten years older?
                                                                                                                                                                  * For a second, I thought that Garp and Dragon must have talked but then I realized that Smoker was also there and could have simply reported it was Dragon, the most wanted man in the world, and Garp could have filled in the rest
                                                                                                                                                                  * Official introduction of the Revolutionary Army. Also, Oda makes good on his promise last SBS to introduce Luffy’s father this volume
                                                                                                                                                                  * Also, Dragon’s and Luffy’s last name is clearly not common knowledge. The WG is probably hiding this info on purpose
                                                                                                                                                                     * Chapter 433

Like the escaped prisoners we get a lot of backstories on, but Jesus, Von Augur, Doc and Laffitte we learn next to nothing about. They don’t seem to have been Whitebeard pirates and Teach apparently sailed backwards along the Grand Line and then back up it so where did he even find them? As best we know they were all assembled when they attacked drum island. The only location on any of them is Laffitte being from West Blue.
                                                                                                                                                                              * While it’s really obvious Haki did not exist as it does today allow me to play the Devil’s Advocate: Blackbeard is eating hits harder than most people implying he can’t use armament Haki at all. So, Ace could reasonably expect Blackbeard to be unable to touch him since Blackbeard can’t even armor himself against Ace’s flames. Or maybe the Yami powers just don’t feel like armament
                                                                                                                                                                              * Also, Blackbeard has never been stated to have CoC anywhere, and he’s never shown using Armament Haki but a random Vivre Card book says he has it so maybe he actually doesn’t have it
                                                                                                                                                                              * Blackbeard specifically says ‘the sun or darkness, which will win?’ not ‘fire and darkness,’ the sun. I’m reminded of Dark Souls for some reason
                                                                                                                                                                              * God, the worst idea came to my head. So, I’ve seen people say Nika’s full color scheme is black and white so he looks like a manga character irl. What if Blackbeard is actually the ink fruit or something so he can make everything disappear by spilling ink on the page.

He was mainly catching pirates which is what the government hired him to do. It’s not like it was some big public defeat.

Makes sense, it’d be pretty hard to make a different actor copy the firsts mannerisms and then do that with multiple actors.

First of all, it’s specifically grapes the user turns into, not spheres or balloons, grapes. He can’t be hurt by blunt attacks but anyone can crush a grape and all of his grapes can fly once he transforms. Second, it’s classed as a Paramecia but grapes are found in nature and he can fully change the shape of his body so he meets both criteria for a Logia. Third (and the scope of this problem is small), shouldn’t plant-based DF’s get their own category since there’s one dedicated to animals? Does he taste like grapes?

In the grand scheme of things where there are billion bounties out there these two are basically equivalent. The difference being that since bounties are directly tied to crimes against the government Luffy’s is actually inflated compared to Moria’s. Moria is a Warlord, so he couldn’t have done anything like invading a major government base, burning the flag and killing the inhabitants. Luffy has committed two major crimes against the government: Revealing the Croc as a fraud and invading Enes Lobby so his bounty reflects that. Moria’s must reflect how difficult he is to capture alone, since he couldn’t have committed any major crimes or the government wouldn’t have hired him

For one, Sanji shares motivation with the series villain Blackbeard. He also just had multiple chapters of righteous anger about his crewmates being molested. But also, Sanji says he’s given up that dream before the chapter even ends

I’m only just noticing that that subject hasn’t been brought up in the story yet. Oda also says Vegapunk will be here Soon™

I don’t disagree. I wonder if he considers the Zoan-weapons to be alive
                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Hogback tries to prove the Zombies are alive by showing Cindry to be nothing but a mindless slave?

He doesn’t look very human nor does he look like any other race like minks or fishmen. He looks like his neck is tied together with shoelaces and he had those before he met Hogback so they can’t be one of Hogback’s weird surgeries
                                                                                                                                                                                                      * In the anime Hogback sounds like Waluigi just before the intermission

For this trick to work you need to keep the shadow’s owner alive, so no death was cheated. This is more like a skinsuit than a revival

Interestingly they also use balloons like the little robots did to get to the moon. It also shows the robots that were already on the moon crying as their masters leave. The moon as depicted here seems to be artificial and hollow. We know its hollow already since Enel found a great underground city.

Even Ivankov didn’t know Luffy was Dragon’s son, so why would Kuma know and then think Ace was also his boss’s son? Moreover, Kuma (a shichibukai) would know that Ace is Roger’s son, muddying the connection further. The WG doesn’t know about the connection between them and neither would the revolutionaries

It had to have happened during the fight and we saw his shadow fly to the castle and reconnect. The sky was also completely cloudless so it couldn’t have been a flashback

I was joking about the nika fruit having a passive AOE to all nakama but now I’m starting to believe it
                                                                                                                                                                                                            * There is a sound effect when Brook says milk cured his broken bones. It’s like the typical ‘don’ whenever anything happens but it’s changed so it’s now ‘bon’ which is a bone pun. Viz translates this correctly but the joke loses all meaning since they’ve been using ‘dooom’ wherever ‘don’ was used.
                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Oars can stretch now. I know it’s just Moria but why don’t the DFs transfer? The shadow is shown to be tied to the body so much that if the original body is destroyed the shadow will disappear too. And the technique that’s actually doing this is how the shadow and owner have to match.

We know now that John was a Rocks pirate so maybe this is another one of those selective spoilers in the SBS (Selective Backdoor Spoilers)

The government could pretend this never happened and get away with it.

This is where we get that single panel of him that is the only image we've gotten of him ever.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * So, Kuma knows that Luffy is Dragon’s son but Ivankov doesn’t. I don’t think any ranks are ever given for the Revolutionary army but I figure these two are equivalent. If they are equivalent then that means Kuma must be in more immediate contact with Dragon. I’ve heard theories that Vegapunk is a revolutionary sympathizer, not sure how I feel about that. Sure, he gives Kuma a few outs, and he declared what was clearly a finished Devil Fruit a failure, but he's also provided tons of tech to the WG so who knows?

TL; DR it’s because he’s a gentleman. It is never explicitly stated whether Zeff or the Vinsmokes made Sanji the way he is

                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * I give Viz a lot of shit, rightfully, but they actually managed to do a pretty good job translating Binks’s Sake, the only parts they missed are ‘with a don’ and ‘funny traveling tale’ but even the traveling tale part they tried to fit in. They also managed to make it rhyme and pace like the original so you could sing it in English. The anime was made years before their translation was released so they could have listened to it and made it match
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * The episode with the song in it is literally named, "Binks' Sake - The Song that Connects the Past and Present" in case you doubted the song’s importance
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * But what is the song actually about? Well, pirates for one. We can say that definitively since they say so themselves and it’s a song sung by pirates. What is Binks’s Sake? I’ve heard theories from literal sake, to laughter, to technological innovation. Personally, I think it's adventure or a stand-in for whatever excuse a pirate uses to send themselves out to sea to find adventure. After all, they're leaving their hometown to become pirates. I think the sun-moon-dawn metaphor is pretty obvious, out there in the world bad things will happen and things will become dark but there will be that beacon of light in the sky to remind you that things can get better. The ‘lose your nerve’ thing is really obvious in the context of this story since determination is the deciding factor in all fights.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * More recently this song is showing connection to the void century. Of course, the song calls itself a ‘funny traveling tale’ and we know Raftel’s real name is Laugh Tale, named after the story that was found there. That connects it to Joyboy so when Joyboy returned and the elephant started talking about the ‘drums of liberation’ that of course connects to the lines about drums in this song. Luffy at that time literally says he’ll turn to bones eventually, another line from this song.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * The line about people turning to bones I think has several meanings. First, I think it is about adventure again, a sort of you-only-live-once kind of thing. Second, I think it’s the idea that people eventually disappear tying into the mad doctor’s idea that people only die when they’re forgotten. Third, I think it also means that no matter who you are, you will die, even if you’re rich and powerful.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * I wonder if there is anything important about the pirate in this song coming from a village of weavers
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Chapter 489

                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Laboon can apparently feel Brook’s resolve returning

It’s definitely not as strong as most arcs before it, I’d even call it generic. Moria does have interesting character traits but they aren’t really expanded on properly. The arc is also very quick which isn’t a bad thing. The final fight with Moria was really flaccid, he basically OD-ed on shadows and then gave up, it was pretty lame. While the emotional moments, ‘nothing happened’ and ‘Binks’s Sake’ were really good they didn’t feel like part of the story of Thriller Bark itself. ‘Nothing happened’ has the problem of being caused by another character that came in at the last minute, and ‘Binks’s Sake’ has the problem of being part of the overall story.

Hachi actually threw the first punch and he was in the wrong to do so. He’s also the one that initially sold Camie off.

While Hachi never managed to hit Zoro with a sword, he did manage to get a headbutt in.

Skypiea and Fishman Island are both that distance from the surface, and Zoro remarks on this.

In the big overarching plot, we have the first official appearance of a Roger Pirate, we also had set-up for Marineford and Wano of all things. Yonko were introduced, Haki was introduced, Luffy’s lineage. Luffy was always related to Garp that much I’m sure of since Oda did a prototype where Garp was still Luffy’s grandfather. Enes Lobby is of course great and it takes up 40% of this section. Thriller Bark was ok, I kind of feel like Oda was trying to rush it out the door so he could move on to what I’ll call, ‘the dark side of the world government’ saga, which is everything from here until the time skip. But back to 400-500, the Villains just sucked this time around, Moria wasn’t explored nearly enough and I’ve already complained about CP-9 in the 300-400 section. I guess you could count the CDs as villains, and while they’re good they’ve only been on screen for like 10 panels. Binks’s Sake was also in this section, and while it doesn’t come up again anytime soon, everything surrounding it is screaming how important it is. If I were to rank the sections so far, it’d be 300-400, 0-100, 200-300, 100-200, 400-500

This isn’t untrue, but Rayleigh also implies that nobody else on the crew did either which is less than true. Rayleigh then says Roger could hear the Voice of all Things; however, he doesn’t say that’s how Roger deciphered the Poneglyphs. But then why would Rayleigh even bring that up, did his dementia kick in? Technically it wasn’t a member of the Roger Pirates who deciphered the glyphs it was a guest from the Whitebeard Pirates but why would they hide Oden’s identity when Rayleigh has been so forthcoming with everything else? Maybe Roger could kind of read them since he already has rubbings of the Poneglyphs and he’s the one who explains how Road Poneglyphs work in the flashback.

Now, Teach just takes it, but shouldn’t he have been able to generate darkness on his face and absorb the hit?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * So, I thought this meeting between Whitebeard and Roger happened when they returned to Wano to drop Oden off but no Roger had already left the crew at that point. So, this flashback takes place on some other Wano-ish Island

I guess the excuse is that he’s drunk

But the admirals took no damage this entire war, Aokiji and Kizaru are untouched and Akainu is just bleeding a little

I wonder if he has to throw the Blanket to stop the spirit of the Devil Fruit from running off and finding a new host
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Of course, there’s the line about his body being odd. Blackbeard of course must be special otherwise why even say he’s special.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * So how does Blackbeard have two? The Yami-Yami must be involved in some way otherwise he’d have already collected a power and grabbed the Yami-Yami if he ever found it. I heard a theory once that Blackbeard uses the Yami-Yami powers on himself to nullify the DF powers in half of his body and he puts the other DF there.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * We actually know that he uses the Yami-Yami to extract DFs since he’s been saying that Darkness absorbs everything.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Teach also didn’t grab Ace’s fruit while he was here despite the means, motive and opportunity. Maybe they only arrived after Ace’s death and there’s a time limit on the body. They threw the sheet on Whitebeard pretty quickly; the time is unclear because there are several panels of narration and reaction shots but the Blackbeards made the sheet their next action after killing him. Literally the next panel Blackbeard is in after he declares Whitebeard dead is him saying to begin the sheet.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * The only person who questions if the process will fail is Shiryu, none of the pirates from Jaya question if this will work

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * I’ve seen this interaction cited as evidence for CrocoMom but I guess people just missed that Buggy is also helping Luffy despite being far more hostile to him in recent chapters. Even before the ‘reveal’ to Croc that Luffy was Dragon’s son which flipped the mom switch, Croc was actually very cordial to Luffy

The first thing we see him do is fight alongside Luffy and the second thing we see him do is save Luffy’s life. Is he supposed to be a villain because he flipped-off Kidd?

That’s a little bit of a problem because Rayleigh shows that you are just feeling the enemy attacking but Enel could tell what Luffy was doing without Luffy actually doing it yet. That’s why Luffy had to bounce his attacks randomly. Problem with that is even if the pattern is random with the current definition of observation Enel should have been able to dodge.

There was so much more in pre than post and post really hasn’t hit the emotional highs of pre. The closest it came was Whole Cake Island but nothing else reaches that level. One thing post is good at is lore but considering it's slightly more than nothing vs nothing I wouldn’t say that’s saying much. Don’t misunderstand, I don’t hate the post time skip but comparing it to pre it just comes out lacking. Pre has East Blue, Alabasta, Skypiea, Enes Lobby, and the war as its major arcs and post only has Fishman, Kaido, and Big Mom and even then, Big Mom is a side quest in Kaido.

He had his shirt closed so it makes sense you couldn’t see it but it’s revelation here makes it seem like it happened during the time skip

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Chopper’s design hasn’t changed over the time skip but his design certainly changed from his first appearance. I’d sooner believe this current version is a member of the fake Strawhats considering how different the designs are

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Zoro’s good, if mostly unchanged. I like that he now matches the early feats of Mihawk.

Any crimes he committed 50 years ago probably hit their statute limitations and we haven’t seen him commit any crimes recently. He wasn’t in any of the government raids and he didn’t attack the CDs so I think Brook is actually clean.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * SBS: somebody accidently predicted the name of one of Sanji’s brothers in a joke.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * 500-600, what can I say? It’s the best section of the entire series. It’s all downhill from here.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * So, 500-600 for real. I really wasn’t joking when I said this is the best part but there are a lot of important reasons why. The big one is that everything that happens in this section is part of a continuous story with one goal which Luffy keeps progressing towards. Every location he goes to serves the story, every villain he fights is intimidating, every ally he makes is interesting, new powers are introduced, new lore is introduced, the villain finally makes his debut. I think it’s completely fair to call this section the peak of One Piece.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Another beta post time skip design page. Franky without the Metroid shoulders looks so much better

It was less than ten chapters ago that armament Haki was invisible and didn’t make contact. Rayleigh said he was only teaching Luffy the basics. I think advanced armament was the plan from the start. I did joke earlier during Skypiea that they were all using advanced observation and maybe they were, currently the only evidence against it is that Rayleigh didn’t say during the initial explanation that you could eventually see the future. And that little girl from Skypiea seemed to use standard observation and they still called it mantra. Maybe haki was always the plan.

It confused me and it confused a lot of other people I know. The reason it’s confusing is that Fishman Island could actually be the All Blue. It is in both the Grand Line and the Red Line and the natives could bring fish from whatever sea they wish to the island underwater.

All he had to do was say that Arlong had a previous bounty of 150 mil or something and say that part of the deal was to wipe the bounties of the Sun Pirates. Then he could have said that the 20 mil was set by the East Blue marines who weren’t familiar with Arlong. There are some plot holes with that but he’s already been heavily retconned and it would make Hody seem like less of a joke

Like they could just arrest Hody and throw him in the dungeons. He seems like he’d admit it in a trial. How is this peaceful society supposed to handle criminals? I know that people have ‘reasons’ but there is a point where you have to say that no reason can justify this action. I think killing the country’s leader might be one of those things. You can dispense justice without hatred.

They didn’t say they wanted to be friends with humans, they didn’t attack you or anyone on your side, they were literally acting on the same desire to live you are acting on right now. What, because they can’t do it, they should be killed? What the fuck is this guy’s character? I’m the best and I’m so the best that I’ll kill every defenseless person within 20 yards? Don Krieg might be a shitty villain but at least his actions made sense within the confines of him being a shitty villain, Hody is just a generic Shonen antagonist.

But the Sea Kings didn’t seem to see it that way, and they made it sound like this happened several times throughout history but the other statements make it seem like this hasn’t happened since the Void Century

Kind of boring, I heard someone recently say that once more is revealed about the story fishman island will look better in hindsight. No. The only thing that hasn’t been paid off yet is Luffy destroying the place, we’ve expanded on everything else: Joyboy, Big Mom, Luffy’s Territory, Fishman on the surface. What I’m really disappointed about is that there is no indication of Nika anywhere despite Who’s-Who saying he was a Fishman deity. They could have just had a little statue in the plaza and said, ‘this is our God whose name we forget but he was fun and just and loved everyone equally’. They had a little idol in Skypiea Oda could have done something like that. Hody was a terrible villain. People like that, people angry on behalf of others, aren’t typically vengeful; they're apathetic. They would let something bad happen to people they don’t like, they’re too cowardly to do anything themselves. Hody also was physically really weak and was propping himself up on the legacy of a much better villain which he retroactively ruined. And also, the energy steroids. The arc really existed to show just how cool and strong the Strawhats were after two years so it really wasn’t the best place to talk about the horrors of racism.  One thing I will applaud Oda for is the even-handedness of it all.  There were very fine people in both species, and I’m not talking about the New Fishman Pirates or the Celestial Dragons who should be condemned totally.

All the fruit in the basket are apples which implies that certain powers like certain fruit. This was also implied by the fact that Devil Fruits will look the same after reincarnation which was how Blackbeard was able to correctly identify the Yami-Yami. I’ve actually seen some crackpots say that he was aiming for Luffy’s fruit and got the Yami-Yami by accident. Just no, that contradicts everything we know about Blackbeard and the fruit

This could be a reference to the fact that Zoans have wills of their own and by preserving the fruit he’ll be able to revive Smiley.

Could it just fuck off to the other side of the planet if it wanted? Since the will of the Nika fruit is human, it might possess human intelligence which is why it was actively avoiding the WG. However, Smiley is just an axolotl so maybe it went to the fruit because it felt safer than being a host-less power

First, the pattern is wrong. What does that mean? The fruit ends up working just fine so why does it have a different pattern? Second, why is it even here? Yes, obviously Vega made it on Punk Hazard and that’s why it’s there but why didn’t he take it with him? The way the exposition comes out later on makes it seem like Vega only told the WG it was a failure to keep them from hounding him about more. But if that were really the case it would be too valuable to leave behind. It would make sense to leave it if it was a failure. But it’s definitely not a failure because Momo eventually does all the same stuff Kaido does. Does Vega think it’s a failure? Seems a little out of character for the genius with a brain 500 years ahead of modern technology. How does he even test it? The fruit is completely intact and Momo gets a power out of it so Vega couldn’t have tested conveying the power. Was Vega making dragons to try and create a new dragon fruit? That doesn’t make any sense either because Momo’s dragon doesn’t look like the Vegapunk dragons at all. Third, and this applies to all artificial fruits, are they weak to water? Surely if Vega was making these things from scratch, he’d go out of the way to remove their one weakness. Evidence from the flooding of Onigashima shows that Smiles are still weak to water. But why? It just seems like the kind of design flaw that you’d try to avoid. Does S.A.D. turn into Lactic Acid when it touches water?

Actually, it's probably an underreaction. From their perspective Kaido was just a strong pirate who started terrorizing their country for no reason. But now they’re 20 years in the future as part of a plan to kill him and they just learned he’s one of the most powerful men in the world.

He has it to goad Luffy but he had no reason to goad Luffy until the previous day and I doubt he managed to find a specific DF that reincarnated two years ago and get it delivered in a single day.

Fishman island wasn’t all that interesting a location and the villains and story weren’t engaging. Hody was a lame villain but I’ve complained enough about him. Punk Hazard was also a boring location: it was either baren ice fields, baren magma fields, or baren lab hallways. Caesar was at least a good villain, not intimidating but definitely vile and hate-able. Like I said earlier this section railroads One Piece to the Kill Kaido Kabuki Khronicles as opposed to the world trotting adventure it used to be.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * This scene of Luffy getting glared at by tough looking men at a martial arts tournament is ripped straight outta Dragon Ball

I used to think nothing of this; but, seeing as how Oda put a question about it in the SBS and then dodged the question I’m less sure.

Also says that no one else on the crew can use Haki

Two years ago there were eleven famous pirates who had higher bounties in less time than Bellamy and he’s still clinging to his bounty like it’s some kind of status symbol.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Some fighter says he heard the real Strawhat Luffy is 20 ft tall

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Totally forgot Jesus is wearing a paper bag on his head.

Why didn’t Blackbeard grab the Mera-Mera when he was within spitting distance of Ace’s corpse? If Blackbeard takes a power himself, can he not ‘Liberation’ it into somebody else? If Blackbeard isn’t taking the devil out with his powers the moment they die then he must be carrying tons of fruit with him. But we know that isn’t the case because of how bad his scurvy is. Not only that but Blackbeard would need to carry tons of the correct fruit for reincarnation to happen, hence why all the fruit around Smiley were apples. Blackbeard did say he memorized all the shapes in the encyclopedia so he’d be capable of this but then that means he’s limited by fruits that only appear in the encyclopedia. However, out of like the 3 fruits they stole, one didn’t use the fruit method, one had no given origin, and the third was the Suke-Suke which we know from Sanji was in the encyclopedia. Maybe he really can only ‘fruit’ DFs from the encyclopedia.

Why doesn’t he just remove every vital organ in his body and put them all in a safe? The organs must still work somehow since the organ typically removed is the heart. And they must remain removed, even while Law is asleep because then giving out hearts wouldn’t make any sense since they’d just disappear later that night? Really Law should just be a walking skin so that he can never be hurt again.

Drum Kingdom had one, Alabasta had one, Dressrosa has one. Were the CDs that snobby even before the Void Century so they just built plateaus but then they found the Omni-Plateau in the Red Line and moved there

He’s not actually all that young and the word used in japanese, while having the upper class connotation, is more weighted towards the ‘young’ meaning. Doffy is in his 40s and Sugar (without the powers) is in her 20s.

This means that everyone in the world already knows what these two things are but they believe they don’t exist for whatever reason.

I’ve seen people say that the surgeon grafts their lifespan onto another but if they could do that why not take a random person’s lifespan and graft that? Not to mention that would only double the patient’s lifespan not make them immortal

Like his seems like a backstory for joining the Revolutionary Army. Not like Doffy where everyone met him with aggression so he returned it.

The other problem is that given the notoriety Sabo has in the story Ace should have known Sabo was still alive. And even though Ace is stupid he should have been like, ‘Oh yeah Luffy, turns out Sabo lived. I saw pictures of him in the paper.’ Oda could have made Sabo forget his real name so the entire time he was going by Obas or something and that’s why Ace wouldn’t have recognized him, but no, everyone in the world knows the RA #2’s real name except the only two people it matters to.

It was certainly better than I remember, but granted I read it over the course of two years the first time, 2 years 5 months and 18 days to be exact. This time I read it over about 10 days which would have been 1 or 2 chapters live. I did feel a little fatigued about it when all the officers were pairing of with the then future grand fleet captains but not nearly as fatigued as I felt in parts of Skypiea. Obviously, considering this entire block is on one island, the pace has slowed to a crawl. It picks up for the next section but then it crashes even harder in Wano. And by then we’re caught up so I think that’s everything I have to say about pace for the rest of my notes. Doffy is my favorite villain, I think he’s the best in the series. He is dangerous and intimidating plus he has major connections everywhere in the world. He also reveals a lot of lore while keeping that pompous CD attitude that makes them so hate-able. Dressrosa itself was a cool location with the toys and the stabby women and the colosseum. But by, like, 45% through that was all gone and it was just Birdcage and rubble so… Oh yeah, Sabo, what the hell was Oda thinking? Honestly his character has served no purpose and it seems he only exists to bring Ace back. And currently he’s dead again. I don’t actually believe he's dead because I think even the worst writers of the world would know better than to kill a character off, bring them back years later to do nothing and then kill them off again. Typically in that middle part they’d do something cool or impart some wisdom. But Sabo exists to do nothing, it's not even like he helped Luffy after his brother died or saved him from some battle he couldn’t have won otherwise. Whatever. Speaking of whatever, the Grand Fleet now exists.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * I’ve seen a lot of debate on how these coordinates work so I guess it’s up to me to settle it. The premise is that we have four rocks each of which has instructions to get somewhere. Those four somewheres, when aligned, will have a convergence point at Raftel. What people argue about is whether or not you actually need all four Poneglyphs to make it to Raftel. Obviously, you can’t do this with just one because you don’t have any context so you’d just end up searching the entire world like you already are. I’ve also never seen anyone arguing that few. People typically start at two. Assuming that the coordinates are (x, y) like they’re depicted here                                                                     then you actually could pull this stunt off with two Poneglyphs if you were lucky. If you manage to get these two                                                                                                                 then yes you could find Raftel. However, if you found these two                                                    or these two                                                                                                           you would have difficulty finding anything. I’ve seen it suggested that if you got two of the off-center coordinates you could sweep up and down until you hit Raftel.                                                                                                                                                 While that is true mathematically, you’d have to travel from Calm Belt to Calm Belt on each wrong pass. And in the Grand Line you can’t just sail aimlessly like that, you’ll get lost. There’s no real way to know your location on empty sea, all navigation is based on islands. If you had three points and (x, y) coordinates then you could find Raftel with 3 more easily. While you are guaranteed a convergence, because you don’t know where the fourth point is you won’t actually know where that convergence is. This leads to many of the same problems as the two-points solution, mainly that if you connect them wrong, you’ll just be wandering the ocean again.                                                                                                                          But you can actually get around this by creating a triangle and then sailing along each edge until you reach Raftel.                                                                                                                                     This actually avoids the problem of traveling aimlessly in hostile waters because you could use Eternal Poses to navigate to the islands and no matter which order you pick as long as you go along all three edges, you’ll hit Raftel. However, there is an even bigger problem. These projections are assuming that the coordinates are flat but the Grand Line has islands above the sky and beneath the ocean so there is a very real possibility that these are (x, y, z) coordinates. In (x, y, z) two-points is fucked, you might as well search the entire world. Three-points is slightly less than fucked, you can manage to pull a convergence out of the three locations                                                                                                                                                                         but good luck because now you have to explore the skies and trenches as well and you can no longer sail along the triangle. The other problem with the (x, y, z) coordinates is that even with the fourth coordinate you’d have the same problem that the third coordinate in the previous picture had, where the convergence isn’t guaranteed. The triangle method would still work; since you have 3-axises, two points must share an axis otherwise there’d be no convergence.                                                                                                                                                                                                     Only problem is now you have even more routes to deal with. Believe it or not the math can get even worse. Another legitimate possibility is that the coordinates are (t, x, y, z), in other words time travel. Now I don’t actually believe this one is going to happen I’m just saying that it’s a possibility; Toki is a character in the story and she did travel over 800 years. While this does have all the same problems as two-points on (x, y) and three-points on (x, y, z) you can still have a 4th-dimensional convergence. Except now you have to search, the sky, the seas, the floor, the past and the future. Again, I don’t believe this will happen. I'm just saying it’s possible to create a four-points (t, x, y, z) convergence. But since Nami says she can draw a map; I have a feeling time travel won’t happen. Anyway, back to One Piece

It occurred to me that by drawing the charts on grids it looks easier than it would be to find a convergence. The reason this happens is because grids have an additional implicit coordinate of 0 making a two-points method technically three-points, three-points four, etc. In the story the Strawhats are unlikely to have the 0 coordinate and my math is based on that assumption.

Recently Zoro cut a man shaped mountain to pieces with relatively little effort. He didn’t even pass out afterwards he went to stop the birdcage. Sanji hasn’t really had any ridiculous feats of strength like that, the best I can give him is that he stalled Doffy for a bit. I guess he can fly by kicking. I guess there was the battle against the New Fishman Pirates but that entire thing felt like the Strawhats were just taking care of jobbers who couldn’t hold a candle to them on their worst day so… He did beat Wadatsumi. I don’t know, it’s just that Sanji really hasn’t been showing off the way Zoro has

Like I said we never actually learn its color because it was never animated but it is likely a standard Poneglyph. Big Mom mentions in her interaction here that Jinbe gave her that Poneglyph and we know it isn’t her Road Poneglyph because the minks knew she had a Road Poneglyph despite living in a remote location, so the fact that she had a Road can’t be recent news.

I’m not saying he should like Sanji, people don’t change their opinions like that especially if they’re wrong, but it doesn’t make sense for Judge to keep calling him a failure with everyone coming over how tough he is.

It's just kind of weird that there are no nice characters anywhere in the world besides on the good guys’ side. And Oda, in trying to sell the deception, actually wrote a really good plot where good-Pudding would be motivated by her sister to run away with Sanji and Luffy pre-approved her for nakama if they were married.

Nobody has said he read the Poneglyphs or anything but Momo did say he was on Roger’s ship so what the fuck is Big Mom talking about. Did Roger lie about how he read the glyphs? I could understand if he couldn’t read the rubbing specifically (since it isn’t technically a Poneglyph) and that’s why he needed Oden but if that were the case he would have just had Oden write up a translation and wouldn’t have hired him for a whole year

This is one of the few things that actually makes more sense with the Nika fruit. However, this is actually Brook’s ability. Brook did the milk-drinking-bone-growth thing way back in Chapter 475. I guess this still kind of makes sense with the Nika AOE theory but it doesn’t restore the crack in Brook’s forehead. That’s a battle scar from when he was alive and, I think, he had it before his Devil Fruit. He had that scar before he entered the Grand Line, I checked. It’s unclear when he ate his fruit, but the crew knew it was the Revive-Revive fruit so I doubt they would have given it to anyone but their captain and their captain was dying for a while there. I bring this up because comical BS may be intrinsic to DFs and that DFs can restore the body back to when it was eaten. Consider this: whatever the ‘devils’ are can morph a random fruit into the exact copy of another swirly magical fruit. Why couldn’t it morph a person? Logia fruits already have the ability to restore a user’s body after disintegration, why can’t other fruits do this? In a way Zoans have this ability too since the user is able to turn back to their original form from whatever they turn into. This bullet point is mostly speculation, I just think its weird that they share this ability and my AOE theory really doesn’t explain the first time it happens

Haki doesn’t make you immune to suffocation and she won’t know what’s happening so she won’t try to attack Caesar directly. Why doesn’t he fill her bedroom with carbon-monoxide, by the time she feels the effects she’ll be too weakened to do anything about it? I imagine he can do none of this because Capone wants to kill Big Mom himself.

Since she is acting irrational, she has no control over her CoC so she can’t coat herself in it to maintain invincibility, hence the blood

When Katakuri was originally introduced he was said to have a Logia. This wasn’t characters misunderstanding his powers, this was Oda’s mistake and it is corrected in all further media to be a ‘special Paramecia’. Mind you, it wasn’t that it was stated once like a spelling error and no one caught it, they called it a Logia more than once. Apparently, this is because it was originally meant to be a flour-flour Logia but was changed during development to mochi. Rubber is more natural than flour, you have to process grain for flour

Think about some other mythical creature, a dragon for example: we know that they can fly, breathe fire and control the winds and look really cool. Since we’ve seen other mythical creatures appropriately depicted in their Devil Fruits, shouldn’t the lore of Elbaf’s sun god be reflected in Luffy’s fruit? I can’t really see what sort of rubber-hose logic could bring a fire to life and stop a town from burning. So why would they believe this was a miracle from the sun god if Sun God Nika is defined by goofiness and rubber?

I heard a pretty compelling theory that the spelling of don is actually really important because it ties into the dawn of the world since dawn would be spelled don in Japanese. I also recently looked into the main translator of One Piece and he claimed on a podcast that he actually knows what the One Piece is. What I’m saying is I don’t think the dons are as important as that theory makes them out to be, assuming the translator isn’t lying.

Zou dragged in a few paces but it also revealed a lot in other places. Whole Cake wasn’t exactly consequential to the story but it was always really engaging to read. Big Mom, in this arc, feels like way more of a threat than she or even Kaido feels like in the next arc. Since the point of this arc was more of a heist than a conquest Big Mom had the privilege of being unbeatable which allows her to be very threatening. She captures everyone on the Strawhats side at one point or another and even takes out one of them. Granted, I felt nothing when Pedro died; he really didn’t have the screen presence of even Carrot so I wasn’t invested. It really feels like Big Mom is an empress, Kaido really doesn’t feel like that. He feels like any other pirate crew that set up in a country. Meanwhile Big Mom had islands and islands of subjects, a system of governance, unique laws, tangible goals, and a royal family. Kaido has a big skull, what is he a bokoblin? I really hope Wano isn’t over. Both Dressrosa and Whole Cake Island were better than I remember reading live, I really hope Wano will be better on Thursday because what we have now was really anti-climactic.

Maybe the hat is made for a giant, maybe Imu is small and the hat is normal sized. To be fair there is a line of D. among the giants. It's one of like 4 D. lines anywhere. Why is it refrigerated?

Points against them being CDs: they don’t wear space suits and interact with ‘normal’ people like the marines or the Shichibukai. I don’t know, I don’t think it matters.

There’s really only two options, Blackbeard and Luffy. Luffy for obvious reasons. Blackbeard because we’ve seen Shanks’ warning people about Blackbeard in the past. With what we know about future events my guess is Luffy, and Shanks told them about the Nika fruit for whatever Machiavellian scheme he’s cooking.

She was recognized by the guard as a dowager of the Sorbet kingdom. A dowager is like a really old princess in royal terms. And she reacts to Kuma who is the former King of the Sorbet kingdom quite emotionally and Kuma is kind of old. Kuma is probably her son

In Sabo’s bad timeline he stays a noble? But then he becomes destitute? It's odd because he still treats Luffy as a brother, maybe this is specifically that he decides to stay when his father takes him home. But it shows Sabo going from stuck-up mustache-twirling villain to vagabond drunk. I think we all know that the CDs are going to be destroyed by the time this story is over and I think this is foreshadowing what would have happened had Sabo sided with them

Also, Hawkins says that the only craftsmen who can make something as small as nails out of Seastone are only in Wano, but I swear I remember somebody having Seastone bullets. I couldn’t find them in my notes so take it with a grain of salt. Actually, never mind that because the tip, just the tip, of Smoker’s Jitte is made of Seastone and that tip looked pretty small to me. Also, this kind of contradicts how Skypiea formed because its actual Seastone in the atmosphere and Skypiea was nowhere near Wano

When I was a kid, I always assumed that the barrel of that bazooka was kind of like a mouth so they just shoved a Devil Fruit into it and that’s how Lassoo was made. Of course, that didn’t make sense with Funkfreed, so Vegapunk must infuse the essence of a fruit into whatever he’s using somehow. So how did this teapot get the tanooki fruit? They couldn’t have used Vegapunk’s method for a variety of reasons. Maybe it really was the Lassoo method and somebody put the fruit in the teapot for storage and then the teapot came to life. Maybe it is gastric acid specifically that brings out the powers and somebody vomited on the teapot while there was a fruit on it.

Or he could do the gear 4th trick where his skin’s all armorry but it still stretches in to absorb the blow.

I said back when Rayleigh was explaining it that I think this was always the intention but I still don’t think what Zoro did in Alabasta was this. Consider this: If the idea for advanced armament was already on the page before the time skip, why did Mihawk teach Zoro to use Haki at all? Why didn’t he say ‘you already mastered armament there is nothing I can teach you’. Advanced is still a bit strange because it's never really stated that the black version is a basic form of it, and it especially doesn’t make sense with Virgo coating his entire body in it and expecting to be taken seriously. Imagine only equipping uncommon gear and then bragging because it matches. But Oda also drew the black armament less than ten chapters after last using the invisible armament

You’d think SMILEs in particular being far more common than regular DFs would have some more information about multiple DFs. And with the people of Ebisu eating them I doubt that they’d be able to track who ate which slice. But then again, they could have only had five and they distributed them very thinly

That reminds me of a theory I heard a very long time ago about DFs. When somebody finds one, they can usually tell its intrinsic value just because of how weird it looks. So, DFs will typically sit out for long periods of time before they’re eaten. In other words, most DFs are just rotten fruit with powers in them

This is what I was talking about with Arlong and how he should be talking about humans. Orochi was alone and that drove him to act the way he did. That hasn’t been shown in a flashback yet but the current day Orochi is acting as if it did. Arlong Park Arlong did not act as if he thought all humans were selfish and stuck-up. People don’t look at rats and go ‘look how stuck up they are’ they go ‘ew, gross, disease’. Arlong had a very opposite reaction to what his retconned motivations were

There was a mention in Chapter 134 (Drum Island) that there was a group of people in a snow country somewhere in the world that don’t sleep because if they sleep they’ll die. That’s literally all the information given but where Blackbeard was found didn’t look very snowy to me.

Recently Jump has been printing little info booklets instead of chapters and the first one actually tied Lodestar Island to the Road Poneglyphs. The translators actually started calling them Lode Poneglyphs as Lode and Road are spelled identically in Japanese and Lode in this context means ‘a guide point for a ship’.

I don’t think it's to be king of the pirates. I also don’t think it's to throw the world’s greatest party or make sure everyone can eat well. I don’t know what it is but none of those sound right to me. Frankly, I’d believe he said “I’ll achieve world peace” a more believable dream. I also just don’t really get why people are interested in this one. Its purpose is to link Luffy and Roger’s wills but we already have a dozen or so examples of this and there are way more interesting mysteries in the story.

I know ostensibly to read the reds but the story has already said, more than once mind you, that Roger could read the Poneglyphs on his own.

Whitebeard’s crew is significantly larger than Roger’s and the surface area of his ship significantly smaller than Wano. Surely Whitebeard’s ship would be ‘too cramped’ for Oden

Imagine Yamato joins the Strawhats and during the final war the Strawhats reconvene with their allies including the Revolutionaries and Ivankov. Ivankov turns Yamato into a boy. Bonney turns Yamaleto into a baby and somehow she gets sent back in time. She is now the real Kozuki Oden, she has all her memories so she knows she now has to fulfill Oden’s destiny to maintain the timeline. That's why Oden says ‘I was born to boil’ because he knows. This also explains why Oden is so invincible while Sukiyaki was such a jobber, because Oden actually has Kaido genes.

This was big at the time but in hindsight it's kind of nothing since he probably just acts like a fishman would underwater. Of course, Kaido’s fruit is based on the legend of a carp that swam up a waterfall and became a dragon. Extrapolating that, people assumed that Kaido’s dragon form is actually his awakened state. I’ve heard (and have been unable to confirm) that in a yet untranslated SBS Oda actually clarifies that the dragon form is the base form. So who knows?

As for 900-1000 there really isn’t much to say considering it's all Wano with a total of 6 chapters outside of Wano. Acts 1 and 2 actually felt kind of rushed and Act 3 feels extremely dragged out. I’m not sick of Wano yet but knowing that there’s about 50 more chapters isn’t helping. Kaido is a kind of cool villain but he doesn’t actually do much this section except Jirens sometimes. I like him better when he’s drunk. Big Mom has kind of been reduced to Kaido’s shrill wife nagging at people. Wano never really felt like “Emperor’s Territory” the way Totto Land did, the Beast Pirates always looked completely out of place.

Yes, Luffy hits the pose of Nika’s silhouette in Skypiea but so does Brook in Fishman Island and the G-5 Marines on Punk Hazard. There’s a whole bunch of other circumstantial evidence like “I’m not a Zoan” but the bottom line is there was never any reference to a character named Nika who was a god of sunlight and freedom. There was a sun god on Skypiea but it was a giant snake and was probably about prosperity and health. Fishman Island, where you’d expect to hear some legends passed between slaves, had no references. When Camie was put in chains, she didn’t pray to the sun god. I really hate to say this but Nika was an ass-pull. The character was introduced a mere 25 chapters before its reveal, which in any other manga would be a huge distance between set-up and payoff, but in One Piece is pathetically small. Compare that count to when Jinbe was first mentioned and when he appeared, 459 chapters.

Yes, I know Who’s-Who is being a racist and all but wasn’t Jinbe supposed to be an Otohime-loving, humans and fish have to put aside their differences kind of guy? He’s either reacting to the two racist statements or he’s reacting to Nika, but it really didn’t seem that he knew anything about Nika. He’s mad at Who’s-Who for the historical inaccuracy, that’s what he says. Who’s-Who barely said anything and Jinbe just completely lost his cool for the first time ever

What’s weirder is they blame the world government for concealing this fact. So if they are so fucking high and know nothing who told them? Either Imu or someone outside the government. That someone outside the government must have pretty deep knowledge of the world, have gone after the fruit in the past, and has red hair

It is a human fruit after all, Chopper gained human intelligence from his human fruit so why shouldn’t the devil in the fruit have human intelligence?

First off, the Nue-Nue. That was stupid and wrong because the Nue-Nue fruit already existed in non-canon material, and as we all know Oda is specifically asked if he has any plans for fruits before they go into the non-canon. I highly doubt that he'd accidently give out the main character’s true fruit for a fucking art promotion. Next, Sun Wukong fruit. This is less stupid than the Nue because of the general influence of Journey to the West on anime and the fact that Oda was very obviously trying to create a Super Saiyan Moment. Its still stupid though, because literally none of the two’s powers align except for strength and endurance. At the moment Nami is more like Sun Wukong than Luffy since she has a staff and a pet cloud. Resin: This actually had a decent piece of evidence this chapter since Luffy appears to melt and Resin is a fluid. But evidence against this was that “resin fruit” doesn’t sound any more intimidating than “rubber fruit” and the WG changed the name for a reason. At this point no one was saying toon powers no matter what anyone says. That wasn’t until next chapter. But even then, it’s still wrong because it misses the mythic god aspect. I saw somebody say it was the “eraser fruit” I have no idea what that guy was talking about

While there is literally only one direct reference and one circumstantial reference to Nika anywhere in the story there are tons of examples of Luffy having toon powers long before this reveal. The only wrench in the powerset is the interaction with Enel but his body doesn’t react the way rubber would anyway, it follows cartoon physics. I’m serious when I say that I think toon world was the plan from the start, maybe it’s actually the Manga-Manga fruit since Luffy apparently turns white. It wouldn’t be the first time Oda changed the name of a fruit but kept the powers and it made everything seem kind of wrong, remember Katakuri’s flour fruit? And that line of ‘a ridiculous power’ has been said a few times

I call it the Nika AOE for obvious reasons. This power has been in the story for a very long time. I first noticed it in Alabasta but there are probably earlier examples that I missed. As you can see Luffy’s allies: Law, Kid, Chopper, Nami and Tama all have the same Nika eye-pops while Kaido’s jobbers have the same eye-pops Oda has been using since the beginning.    Notice that Oda felt the need to draw five separate characters, each with various levels of loyalty to Luffy all sharing the expression that is linked to his new powers. What I believe happens, is when Luffy considers someone an ally, he unconsciously transfers some of his powers to them. Notice how Tama, who was not initially part of the raid is also affected. I’m not even sure Luffy and her have crossed paths this evening, and her announcement for everyone to switch happened while Luffy was off the island.             So I don’t think Luffy is consciously choosing who to affect with the AOE; I think he just spreads it to people he considers Nakama. Luffy has always been governed by cartoon physics but so have a lot of the Strawhats. The first example that started me down this thought process was Usopp’s fight with Mr.4 and Ms. Christmas. Usopp leaves him-shaped holes in the walls when he is smashed through them                                              Now, Usopp isn’t the first character besides Luffy to manifest these traits, but it is weird because so far Usopp was one of the only characters who didn’t have a devil fruit whose body was acting strangely. In the same fight-arc the pin-cushion Baroque lady actually does do a sort of Popeye power where she injects herself with her needles to make herself stronger. Also in that same fight-arc Sanji’s lust-heart-eye gets smacked directly by Mr. 2.                              According to my notes the tooniness of the world seems to drop off severely after Alabasta but another thing I found is that Yosuku is instantly healed from scurvy when given Lime juice. Notably he was given the juice after Zoro introduced him and Johnny as friends of his.                                         Going forward in the story past Alabasta, the next example I found was on Enes Lobby, and at this point my notes start referring to it as the AOE directly. The Strawhats crash the Rocketman and get out completely unscathed. And I think it is this page that completely solidified the idea in my mind. Ch. 400 Pg. 8                                   The fact that Franky is saying that none of them are normal and the light damage everyone took is “ridiculous” and Luffy’s powers are described as “ridiculous” in the story makes me think that this is an effect of the Nika. The next thing I have comes from Brook in Thriller Bark where he drinks milk to heal himself. While most of the Strawhats, including Brook himself, don’t consider him joined at the moment, Luffy does. Not that it matters anyway because Luffy gives the powers to even passing acquaintances, see Kokoro and Chimney. But what’s weird to me about Brook is that he says the part about milk with confidence, as if he’s already tried this before meeting Luffy and it worked. My notes go dark for a while on this topic aside from the occasional snark about how the Nika silhouette appears everywhere. The next instance is on Whole Cake Island. I should note, I read one volume a day for months, so though I didn’t make a note of it every time I saw it the idea for the Nika AOE was slowly gestating, changing from just a joke to an actual theory. By the time I reached Whole Cake Island I actually believed it. And then this happens,                                                                                          Depicted is Yonji getting his face, very cartoonishly, smashed in with a hydraulic press. When I intially saw this I thought, ‘finally the proof I need to disprove this stupid joke-theory’ unfortunately in the month or so since I read it I actually realized that this is congruent with the theory. At this point in the story, Luffy is not aware of Sanji’s family issues. He has also met two of Sanji’s family members personally and one of them saved his life. All he knows is that this is his beloved cook’s younger brother and his older sister just saved his life. Why wouldn’t Luffy think they’re friendly? They don’t really say anything Luffy would find objectionable like ‘oshiruku is gross’. But there is an even bigger piece of evidence in Whole Cake Island                                                                                   This was actually one of the first pieces of evidence people cited when discussing how far back the nika fruit went, but most people missed the fact that Brook also recovered in the same way. Notice how that gangster yells, ‘how do your bodies even work?’ That line about bodies happens often and I think that that is how Oda signals to the audience that this is the Nika AOE and not just a regular gag like this one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   And this milk scene is even more of a smoking gun when you consider the SBS question pertaining to it.                  At this point I believe the Nika AOE 100%, I know some people think the SBS is bullshit but they’re wrong. Oda spoils a lot in the SBS but he usually does it pretty sneakily. For example in Volume 15 (Little Garden) the SBS depicted the christening of the Going Merry, except the bottle didn’t break and Oda explicitly states that’s bad luck for the ship. So yes, I believe that this is really happening and I believe that beyond a shadow of a doubt. Any way I’ve been writing this dot alone for over 2 hours so I’ll just round up the last pieces I have: 926 Kid fattens up and he is technically an ally since he has helped and never directly opposed Luffy, 947 Old man Hyo gets his head stuck in a wall and his neck stretches as Luffy pulld him out, 1044 Kaido. Kaido is a bit strange and is certainly a counterpoint but there is overwhelming evidence in favor. I think it can just be explained as Luffy spewing his power everywhere because he doesn’t completely understand it yet.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * So yeah, that’s the Nika AOE, I don’t really like the idea of Luffy sharing his powers but I can’t really deny it either. I actually like that he uses cartoony powers in his fights though, it gets One Piece back to its roots instead of Dragon Ball. Speaking of which, re-reading this arc, Oda was trying so hard to make his own Super Saiyan moment. Between Luffy dying, the fact that he’s fighting ‘the strongest evah’, and even the hair color it's clear he was mimicking Super Saiyan. I’d say he even succeeded given all the hype I saw that chapter

I’m actually a little surprised at myself for sticking through this all the way. Originally, I was just going to read to refresh myself and see if there were any details about Nika but around volume 4 I realized that I had a lot of thoughts on a lot of things so I started to take notes and I’m really glad I did.

There are so many little errors throughout the entire run. They still call him Zolo to this day. And the stuff is especially bad towards the front.

The curtains still haven’t closed on Act 3 and I’m not ruling out the possibilities of Acts 4 and 5. For those who don’t know a lot of the stuff in Wano is based on Kabuki plays and those are typically 5 acts. I really hope that isn’t the case, I’m sick of Wano. We've been here for 4 years. But at the same time there’s a bunch of dangling plot threads in Wano. And they also can’t leave yet because they still haven’t found Kaido’s Road Poneglyph

Idk. Right at the start of this project I found what I thought to be pretty definitive evidence in that the narrator explicitly calls Shanks a good man but that was before the chapter where the narrator put his foot in his mouth about Kaido v. Luffy so that’s worthless.

Honestly, I don’t care. At this point I’m more interested in the secret history and any treasure the One Piece is could only disappoint this far into the story.

I’m not sure if I made this clear but I actually really don’t like the idea that Luffy is rubberizing his allies. There was just too much evidence to deny that it was happening. There is probably even more evidence that I missed. I just checked Sanji’s introduction and he doesn’t do the heart-eye thing until after Luffy asks him to join. The first time he does it is when he meets Nami which is after he feeds Gin.
